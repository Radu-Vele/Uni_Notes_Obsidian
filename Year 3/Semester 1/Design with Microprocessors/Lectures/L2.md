# I/O System

Presumably the most important part of the microcontroller

## Ports
> [!note] Port = 8 bits
- instructions are executed based on ports
- ATMEGA has PORT A ... L
- accessed either with in/out or st, ld (depends if internal or external Registers)

Representations of a port
	- **DDRx** register configures ports as in (0) or out (1)
	- **PORTx** - for writing
	- **PINx** - for reading

A pin has attached:
- 2 **diodes** (connected so that they don't connect current) 
	We value their property that when the voltage becomes very high (**static electricity** - high V low I) they conduct in the reverse order and take it to ground and VCC $\Rightarrow$ pin damaged but the internal circuit is fine
- **capacitor** (for noise filtering)
- pull-up **resistor** (for keeping logical 1) - electrically controlled (transistor)

Each resource on AVR is associated an address:

|0x02 |<Address accessed by the in/out instructions>|
|-|-|
|(0x22)| <address in the data memory Port address + 20 - after the register>|

### Pin structure for 2 behaviors
![[Pasted image 20221010125943.png]]

### Research ðŸ“š:
Pin as input:
- Tri-state gate (controlled bu SLEEP)
- Trigger-Schmidt (noise filtering)
- Pull-up resistor 
	- We can implement also pull-down resistors (external from the board)

- MCUCR - contains PUD (Pull-up disable) for all pins
	Can set a bit to one **SBI** and set to zero with **CBI** 

Example:
- buttons and leds
- LED matrix (use pwm ish)
- 7 segment display (transistors used to deflect the intensity from cathodes)

## LEDs
- LED = diode:
	- if $V< V_{th}$ then it doesn't light up , but after $\ge$ it behaves like a "wire" so there is a **high current**, there also is a excessive voltage that needs to be consumed by a **limiting resistor** 

$$I = \frac{V_R}{R} = \frac {V_{CC}-V_F}{R}$$ VF is the led typical voltage, Vcc is the output voltage on the led


## Arduino I/O
- recommendation: don't use RX, TX pins when the computer is connected to the board.

$PINs \to AVR\_Controller\_pins$

- but not all controller ports are connected to digital pins 

### Debouncing ðŸ”˜
- may be needed in case of buttons
	- In case of Pmod BTN we don't need to implement it
	- code example in slides (simple loop that checks the stability of the signal)

Example:
- Keypad: 
	Concept - the key doesnt have only one key
		- 7 pins (4 rows, 3 columns)
		- a button press makes **contact** between a column and a row 
			Connect rows to VCC (no resistors needed as we use internal pull-up resistors), the columns are given a bit that determines a change of the pin value if a key is pressed (repeatedly in a loop)
	Therefore the coordinate of the key is known and is mapped to a know letter

Code provided in the slides - cool

## I/O ports
- reminder: pins are connected to internal ports 
	(PA, PD, PB, PE, PA, ...)
- example: alternative light LED
	1. Sequential option
	2. Faster option using Port 


``` c
void setup() {
	DDRA = B11111111
}
void loop() {
	PORTA = B01010101;
	delay(1000);
	PORTA = B10101010;
	delay(1000);
}
```

> [!note] Our approach
> Use registers, ports, and other in-built components for I/O.
> You should know the available MCU resources
