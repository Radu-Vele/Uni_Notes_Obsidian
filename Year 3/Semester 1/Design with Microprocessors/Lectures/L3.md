# Interrupt system

## Stack
---
- useful for calling functions
- interrupt $\Rightarrow$ function call
- Stack $\in$ RAM
- Add to stack $\Rightarrow$  SP decreases (16 bit)
- Stack is mapped to I/O (use `in` `out` operations for HIGH and LOW bytes)

### Stack operations:
`push`, `pop` -like

```c
push Rx
pop Rx
rcall address
ret
```

> PC has 17 bits (instructions have 16 bits, and LSB is **never** used) $\to$ it needs 3 stack positions (8-bit)

---

## Interrupts
---
- controlled by I bit (0 $\to$ no interrupts | 1 $\to$ interrupts are addressed) in **SREG**
`SEI`, `CLI` instructions

- **Behavior**
	1. Peripheral sends request to CPU (same chip though)
	2. Current instruction is awaited to finish
	3. TOS = PC && SP -= 3
	4. Interrupt vector is accessed *IV= address predefined for an interrupt source (system goes there when a specific interrupt happens)* - contains  a jump to a ISR
	5. ISR (Interrupt-Service-Routine)  is accessed (user-defined function)
	6. CLI (clear interrupt flag) (refuse to accept any other interrupt)
	7. Execute the ISR
	8. Return (`RETI`) from ISR 
		`SP += 3`
		`PC = TOS`
		`SEI` - restore the interrupt flag to accept other interrupts


### Nested interrupts

- `SEI` called inside the **ISR** - might get into infinite nested call (like a deadlock)

> Handler = **ISR** written by the programmer

- interrupts are called out-of-order (not always known at compile-time)

In ASM:

```x86
INT 21H

IRET ;Returning from the ISR. Different from INO as in the 
	 ;x86 the IRET determines restoring the FLAGS (pushf 
	 ;included at calling ... popf)
```

### Example
- user input: keyboard, clicks

For *ATMEGA*:
- Predefined interrupts: RESET, INT1..7,  SPI STC, Timer interrupts, many other included in the Interrupts table (present in slide)

## External interrupts
- attached to 8 bits
- programmer-configurable (need to activate them *-disabled by default*)

1. Pick an interrupt INT0..7
2. Check the PINs connected to it
3. For each interrupt there are 2 bits (**EICRA** 0-3, **EICRB** 4-7 registers for the interrupt control signals)  that have meaning taken together (00/01/10/11) 
4. Enable (**EIMSK** - mask register) - write a 1 into the bit corresponding to the desired interrupt
	accessed with `in` & `out`, in arduino code we can access it with `EIMSK` keyword

Example: for a ðŸ”²button $\to$ falling edge (pull-up resistors

- other interrupts are more distributed (UART, SPI, ...) but can also be enabled / disabled

```AVR
.org 0x0000
	rjmp main
	
.org 0x0002 ;as the INT0's vector points to 0x0004 address
	rjmp isr_INT0

... ; add mode interrupts

main:

; initialize SP

; initialize and configure INT

; activate the 
...

isr_INT0: ; ISR label
	dec r17
```

### TODO:
- Exercise 1: create a counter using buttons (no INT system)
	Approach: memorize the past state and current state of the button and act when **current** $\ne$ **past state**


## Interrupts with arduino
---
- different boards have different numbers of external interrupts (ATMEGA has 6)
- arduino encompasses all procedures described above into one instruction
- `attachInterrupt(interrupt, ISR, mode);` - wrapper function over the microcontroller Interrupt procedure (Enabling, setting mode, and so on)
- opposite: `dettachInterrupt(/*no parameters implies all interrupts*/);`

### Example: measure pulse width
- use interrupts that work on change
Function used:
```
milis(); // nr of miliseconds since program started;
micros(); // nr of microseconds since program started;
```

> Volatile variables are given the meaning that the compiler shouldn't optimize the code around those variables (don't put them in registers, don't make assumptions around them). Better declare our variables volatile because the flow of the program is not known at compile-time

### Number Confusion ðŸ˜µ
- Interrupt number $\ne$ PIN number 

`digitalPinToInterrupt()` Macro to be sure we find the interrupt 

## Practical use: 

1. We don't know the behavior of the button, but want to create a program that works for both rising and falling edge behavior
	ðŸ’¡ Set the interrupt on change

```c
int initial = 0;

void setup() {
	pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP); //can make it pullup just in case
	attachInterrupt(0, btnPress, CHANGE);
	initial = digitalRead(2); //assume that when the system is started the button is released
}

void btnPress() {
	if(digitalRead(2) != initial) {
		//button has been pressed
	}
}

void loop() {
	
}
```

2. Program that receives asynchronous data
	- use the clock as interrupt signal

```c
int clk = 2; //interrupt 0;
int data = 3; //any PIN
int val = 4;

volatile b = 0; //receive a byte on the data
				//important to declare it as volatile

void setup() {
	pinMode(clk, INPUT);
	pinMode(data, INPUT);
	pinMode(val, INPUT);
	attachInterrupt(0, receiveBit, FALLING)
	b = 0
}

void loop() {
	//doesn't really matter, can print to a serial terminal
}

/**
* Appends a bit read from the data to b 
*/
void receiveBit() {
	if(!digitalRead(val)) {
		//must assume that the data is MSB first
		b = b << 1;
		if (digitalRead(data)) {
			b = b | 1; //could also do b = b | digitalRead(data)
		}
	}
}
```

3. Additional behavior (mark the begnning and end of transmission) - UART-like
	- don't overcomplicate with two signals (the ending of the transmission can occur after 2 bits)
