# I2C and Arduino Specific Stuff

## I2C

More transmitters and more receivers are allowed

>[!info] Open-Collector Configuration
> - pull up resistors are holding the lines at HIGH
> - if a participant (or more) pulls level to LOW there is nothing that can be done to bring the level back to HIGH
> - transistors are used to pull to LOW ore release (write the signal to the base of transistor)
> - also the line can be read using a buffer (amplifier)

### How to identify devices
- use addresses

### Types of devices
- Master
	- `transmit/receive`
	- on transmission a slave must receive
	- on receive it requests data from slave and the slave must send
- Slave
The roles can be switched

> [!warning] Rule
> Data line is stable when clock is 1 and changes when clk =  0 (level based, not edge based)
> Exceptions: `start` and `stop` bits

### Events
**Start** - data goes from 1 to 0 and clock is 1

**Transfer data** 
- between S and P
- contains address and data
- initiated by `master` who owns the `clock` 

- first 7 clk cycles:
	- send address (7 bits) of the slave starting with MSB (bit 6)
- next 1 bit:
	- operation `0 = write` `1 = read`
- next 1 bit:
	- ACKNOWLEDGE (0 if ACK, 1 if NACK) like a `ready` bit
	- written by the partner that receives 1st part
- next 8 bits:
	- DATA sent with MSB (7) first
- next 1 bit:
	- ACK bit

> [!info] The master sends the clock
> So that slave can use it to read/write/other operations

**Stop** - data goes from 0 to 1 and clock is 1


### Arbitration
- necessary when:
	- the bus is free and more devices try to become masters (1 allowed)
	- they write on the bus and check if what they have written has been correctly put on the bus (0 wins)
	- if the check fails the master stops and tries again later

### Transmission speed
- master and slave need to be able to process data at the same speed
- how can the slave slow down master?
	`Clock stretching` - try to keep SCL to 0 for some more time
	- nice feature

### When is it used?
- build a complex system using 2 wires only (for communication)

# Serial interfaces on `Arduino`

## UART on Arduino
- some interfaces are used for programming / PC communication
- 4 interfaces on ATMega (hardware based)

### Usage
- board - PC or board - board communication

> [!warning] Always connect transmission to reception and reception to transmission
> `TX` $\to$ `RX`
> `RX` $\to$ `TX`
> Because in case we do the opposite the connection would create short circuits and damage the modules. ☠ ⚡

- should think from the point of view of the device (does it send or receive data over that bit).

### Arduino abstraction - `Serial` library

- `begin` configure baud rate, other options include selecting data size (5 $\to$ 9), parity (N/O/E), no. of stop bits (1/2) - 30 combinations
- `print` - send data in human readable form, can add format, nr of decimals for float data
- `println` - add end of string character 
- `write` - doesn't format data, can write buffer of a specified length
- `read` - safest for reading (read ONLY one byte at a time), to read more bits (as they have been written) use `available()` that returns the number of bytes read (stored previously in a 64 byte buffer). 

Therefore, approx. 1 byte is sent per 1ms, the program moves faster so we can use `flush` to wait until the transmission is complete

- `serialEvent`- is a *callback* function - called when the buffer has data
	- we can define the wanted behavior in this function
	- can have multiple ones

#### Examples
- multiple serial ports on
- communicate with pc
	- convert character to number
- use Serial Event
	- Replace `if available` with `while available` to read all bytes from buffer

### Software serial Library
- useful for Arduino UNO as it has 1 Serial interface
- must connect RX (software defined PIN) to a pin that is able to produce a PIN-CHANGE interrupt
- all that is done using the HW interface can be done here

> [!note] Software Serial Interface is limited in speed
> because it is a software interface (up to baud rate 9600)

#### Examples:
- create a communication relay between PC and other devices through the board.
	- useful for configuration communication devices
- gps receiver

## SPI on Arduino
- one controller on ATMega

### SPI Library
- only used as a master (master mode)
- functions are designed for configuration of SPI Interface, and transfer data
- can achieve SPI as software by using `serialOut(byteToSend, dataPin, clkPin, dataOrderMSBorLSB)`

#### Examples:
- control digital potentiometer

## TWI = I2C
- naming is changed because of copyrighting reasons

### Abstraction: `Wire` library

#### Mechanisms:
- begin without parameters (master device), begin with address parameter (slave device with assigned address)

#### Master side:
- request data from slave a quantity of bytes
	- request until an event (boolean or so)
- send data to slave (begin transmission and then write)
- end the transmission (send data and ends transmission)
- set clock speed (up to 400 kHz)

#### Slave side:
- can write a value only at master request
- check if there are bytes available to read and read them
- register a function to be called `onReceive()`

#### Handlers:
> Handlers are similar to ISR, called by the system when the slave has to do something.
> Depend on the clock of the master.


> [!note] Connect the common GND 🌏

### Important trick
- the slave can become a master if we determine it from some input or so
- careful to check which devices allow us to do that
- generally make sure to know the sensors or used peripheral communication protocols
