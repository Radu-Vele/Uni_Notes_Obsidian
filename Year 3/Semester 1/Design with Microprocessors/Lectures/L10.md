## Data transfer modes
- reading and writing data to and from I/O devices

### By program
- issue `in` command from CPU ...
- issue when we need to transfer a lot of data

- maybe we can skip the status check for the I/O module all the time
### Interrupt
- can do something else after issuing the read command
- interrupt synchronizes I/O device

### DMA
- will be discussed in the next lecture 

> [!info] DMA (Direct Memory Access)
> - useful when a `large block of data` is transfered between the MEM and an I/O device (e.g. disk controllers, network/sound/video cards)

- achieved by adding a DMA controller that deals with all transfer operations (additional power)

## Intrerrupts
Three kinds:
- internal (Software triggered, Errors, Exceptions)
- external (maskable non maskable) => 2 interrupt pins (`NMI` -non-maskable-, `INTR` - requested -)

### Non-maskable 
- = cannot be disabled using flags or so
- reserved for critical events (dangerous errors)

### Maskable

```
; Significant operations

CLI     ; clear Int Flag

STI     ; set int Flag

INT n   ; 
	    ; INT 10 causes the processor to trigger it

IRET    ; return from the ISR - restore everything from the STACK

INTO    ; overflow
HLT     ; halt the program to wait for external interrupt

WAIT    ; 
```

#### Interrupt trigger actions:
- CPU puts FLAGS on the STACK (SP -= 2)
- trap flag and interrupt flags are disabled
- save code segment register saved
- the instruction pointer is saved 

- take 2 val from int vector table 
	- 4 bytes for each interrupt (CS_ISR  and IP_ISR (stored as abs address) )
	- IP_ISR = offset in the code segment of the ISR
	- CS_ISR = the code segment that contains the ISR
- the int vect table is write-able (in RAM)

#### Interrupt vectors
- stored from addresses 0 to 1kB (256 x 4B)

#### Interrupt in the context of instruction execution
- interrupt requests are checked at the end of the current instruction

Mechanism:
- how to fit all 256 interrupts on only one pin?
	- CPU writes two Interrupt acknowledge (answer to requests) signals (in 2 cycles of the processing)
	- at the second time the data regarding the vector interrupt selected is received on the lower part of the DATA bus (sent by the device that produces the interrupt)
	- it is written at the end of the second INTA signal

#### Example:
- see pdf

> [!warning] Arbitration issue
> - might have multiple interrupts to be handled a the same time

### Arbitration

#### Polling
- not smart
#### Daisy chain ðŸŒ¼
- priority imposed
- the int closest to the processor is processed first
- the daisy chain logic lets INTA propagate through the devices in an imposed order
- issue: introduce delays for the devices `not so dangerous if we don't have many devices`

### `8259A` Interrupt controller
- solves the issues related to interrupts
- define priority of the 8 channes
- can enable and disable the channels using data received from the BUS (like a regular device)
