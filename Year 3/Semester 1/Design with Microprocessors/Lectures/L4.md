# Timers

8/16 bit structure in slide
- timing issues are solved in hardware - timers

## 8-bit timer configuration
- the timer is controlled through TCCRnX register

Waveform Generation Mode:
- mode of operation of the timer

### Clock selection
- there are 8 modes
- use internal (using the prescaller or the board master clock) / external clock source
- clock selection uses 2 MUXes

> Prescaller = another 10-bit counter that offers as output

Functioning: 
- for the LSB a rising edge comes at 2 rising edges of the input clock (f = input_f/2), as we move to the MSB the frequency keeps on being divided by 2.
- for MSB $f=\frac{f}{2^{10}}$
- not all bits are offered as variants

  ### Counter unit
  - counting register based on control signals
  - accessible to the user through DATA bus

### Comparison Unit


### Timer generated interrupts
Can call ISR defined for Timer Generated Interrupts

## Examples


### 1. Generate a 50Hz signal
- use the CTC mode

### 2. 

Remark: spend as little time as possible in a ISR
