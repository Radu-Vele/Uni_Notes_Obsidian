# Memory Interfacing 

### Hierarcy
- based on closeness to the processor, speed, ....

## Classification
- similar to SCS class

- EEPROM can be erased with normal Voltages (used for Data processing and stuff) while EPROM need higher voltage (additional device)

#### Flash memory 
- a subset of EEPROM that has as a special thing - speed of erasing;

## Generic Pinout

|Address PINs| Data PINs| Control PINs|
|-|-|-|
|n-bit address => $2^n$ locations|output or I/O data|Chip select, R/W|
|*not* bi-directional|*need* to support high impedance||

> [!info] Remark
> The nr of address bits $\ne$ (necessarily) the nr of data pins

```
e.g. 10 address bits => 1K of locations (that can be Bytes, Words, etc.)
```

## Internal structure
- linear or matrix-like
### Linear
- use a decoder to select the address line we want to read
### 2-D 
- get a cell at intersection of row and col

## Connection of different memories

### ROM/EPROM
- programmed via Vpp
#### Useful pins:
- `A0-A10` - 2K locations (bytes)
- `O0-O7` - data word
- `!CS` - chip select

#### Timing
- Access time - until data is valid on Data pins (until that the pins are on *High Impedance*) (`450ns`)
- several other metrics for the delays:   ...
- the delay must fit the **8086 Bus timing**
$$Acc_{time-max} = 3*T-TCLAV-TDVCL$$

### Address decoding
- need to place the chip in our memory space (for 8-bit bus)
- we make sure we are in the proper memory area

- to create a bigger memory we can cascade multiple smaller ones using a decoder for the `CS`
	- the unused address lines
- **Wait state generator** - used to pause the clock generation until the data from EPROM is retrieved

### Connect chips

#### Parallel connection
- same input, same output
- chip select determines chip activation
- extends memory **DEPTH**
#### Serial connection
- extent **WORD Size**
- same address different bits for output
- the same chip select

### 8086 Configuration
- issue addres and command to both on the same time
- address:
	- we skip the first bit (LSB) because we want to address words (every other 2 addresses) 
		- `A1<->A13` 
- additional control signals:
	- determine to read WORD/UPPER/LOWER Bytes: `BHE, A0, ROMSEL`
