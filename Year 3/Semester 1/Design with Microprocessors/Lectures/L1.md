# Lecture 1

## Microprocesors
- Integrated circuits with most of CPU functions
- Instructions execution steps

```

- Integrated in **microprocessor based systems** with conventional components

>[!QUESTION] Does the CPU part include a Memory in-built?

 > [!REMARK] Bus = Control + Data + Address
 > Links everything together
 
**Practical example:** PC Motherboard

*Cool facts:*
- The BIOS (default running program) is stored in The System ROM 
- PCI is an expansion slot and other new ones (USB, ...)
- There also are virtual devices (Bluetooth)

>[!INFO] Our purpose
>We won't design the MbS, but work with MICROCONTROLLERS

## Microcontrollers 

Microcontroller = Motherboard On a Chip

### Parts:
- CPU (microprocessor)
- Memory
- Useful devices (I/O, PINs, timers, Interrupt Controllers, Serial interface, SPI, I2C)

> interfaces are activated by the code

### Parts to add next to the chip on a board:
- Oscillator (CLK)
- Stable voltage provider
- PINs

For designing Microprocessor based systems we will focus on certain goals.

Example of outcome: **Autonomous robot**

- **Issues**: 
	- driving in a straight line (small changes in DC motor functioning)
	- no feedback from the motors
	- Solution (use reflective sensors to track the wheel movement using white stripes)
	- External power is needed (*Edge bridge* circuit is used for powering the motors and controls come for **MCU** i.e. microcontroller)

> [!REMARK] Arduino boards can be used to make custom interfaces between HW and SW
> E.g. take an old system in an astronomical observatory and interface a PC to the arduino and to Relays that are connected to the old motors

 Arduino works with everything (all OSes) :)


## AVR 8 bit microcontrollers
- Microchip not owns ATMEL
- family of microcontrollers (different in terms of pins and memory)
- different compatibilities with programming tools/power options

### Architecture of the Microcontroller

> [!REMARK] Harvard architecture

### Logical structure
- reminds of the MIPS
- Registers, ALU, PC, Flash Memory (Program memory), Flags, Peripherals, EEPROM, and more
- EEPROM has the purpose to store **non-volatile** data in low amount *for example passwords*.

### Timing diagrams
- track the execution of instructions (1 clock cycle / instruction) using **Pipelining** (overlap current IF with EX of previous instruction)
- Special instruction that needs 2 clk cycles is the **SRAM** (operates at high speed -CPU clk speed = MEM clk speed-, expensive tho) memory access instructions.

### Components
- GPR **General-Purpose 8-bit registers** 

|Register Set|Purpose|
|-|-|
|R16-R31|Immediate loading|
|R26-R31|Can be used as Pointers to memory locations, but in pairs => X, Y, Z adresses|

```c
X = R27 : R26
Y = R29 : R28
```
>[!NOTE] Every component in the MCU has a memory address

- **Instructions** specific to RISC (not as many instructions as in x86 ISA)
	- mov -> only for refisters
	- ldi -> loading immediate values
	- logic + arithmetic instructions (add, addi, sub, rol, lsl, ror, inc, dec...)
	- Special: Multiplication (this time the destination is not the first opperand, but result is stored in R1:R0)
```asmatmel
add [DESTINATION], [SOURCE] //x86 style

//in MIPS it was different

add [SOURCE1][SOURCE2][DESTINATION] // won't use this way
```

>[!REMARK] The rotation adds the CARRY flag not the LSB

**Data Memory Space (SRAM)**
	- there is a memory map used to map all accessible locations
	- many more I/O registers are used accessible through Load and Store
	- internal SRAM (between RAMSTART `200`, RAMEND `21FF`), 8kB
	- **Internal vs External SRAM**: external SRAM is not attached by default on **Arduino** but some boards support it
	- has specific instructions LOAD&STORE (that's how all access to mem is performed)
	- lds = load from abSSSolute

|Addressing|Explanations|Example|
|-|-|-|
|**direct**|||
|**indirect**|use pointers to High and Low bytes denoted X, Y, Z|
|**auto-increment indirect**|load value and then increment the address (or increment before)|

In x86 there was **movsb** instruction somehow similar to auto-increment indirect addressing (base for memcpy, memmov)

```c
//movsb , similar to movsw, lodsb, lodsw

[ES:DI] <- [DS:SI]
DI++, SI++ //increment or decrement based on the D flag
```

**Program Memory (FLASH)**
	- largest memory (256 kB for AT2560 *or so*) (lots of constants are used for fast programs) divided in words, but **byte-addressable**
	- we won't manually load the program, but we can add constants, LUTs
	- readable and writeable through instructions (LPM , ELPM, SPM) used with the Z pointer (only words can be written, not bytes)
	- Z pointer address only has 16 bits, so another register RAMPZ helps us address the entire memory through ELPM
	- Cool fact, **SPM** helps us modify the program memory from R1:R0 (**Arduino** does that when the Bootloader program writes into the FLASH our program)

> [!Question] The AVR ISA is similar to ARM ISA?

**Flags**
	- SREG holds flags and control bits. Treated like a I/O port accessed through in / out instructions


To be continued with ISA...
