# DRAM Recap
Facts:
- address is multiplexed
	- a memory with $2^n$ locations has $\frac{n}{2}$ lines
- commands:
	- **read**: `OE_L = LOW`  & `RAS_L = LOW && CAS_L = LOW`
		- there is a fix delay before data is valid (prv is junk)
	- **write**: `WE_L = LOW` and address read and `DATA_IN ready` (needs to be available before CAS) 
- both read and write refresh rows

> [!important] Memory refreshing
> - keep the data alive by doing `"fake reads"` of rows
> 	- generate row address and trigger `RAS` => row is refreshed
> 	- traverse all rows to refresh the entire memory ($2^{n/2 - 1})$
> 		- use a counter for that
> - circuit that does that thing is `HOLD-HLDA` + bus hijack 👨‍✈️

### HOLD-HLDA 
- 2 signals that generate a hold and receive an acknowledge

Components of the circuit:
- signal generator that yields a waveform (enough frequency to cover the whole memory before data is lost) 
- counter on 8 bits (counter of rows)
- D FF that generates the hold signa for processor
- cpu sends HLDAck to the RAS signal activator + D FF resetter
- the HLDA also activates the 3state buffer that allows row addresses to go to the address bus
- reset mechanism for the counter (take an output and when it becomes 1 trigger counter reset) (we may need a comparator for resetting or so)
	- without it time is lost (refresh non-existing rows)
> Trace the circuit to fully understand it

## Reality-check 
- nowadays the memory has an automated refresh mechanism embedded in the die.

Hidden refresh:
- other mechanisms could be used to trigger the refresh (trigger RAS after CAS to let the memory recognize this combination) - no processor block

> [!question] Does the processor wait for the refresh before allowing addresses?
> - no, the data bus is still valid, so the CPU can issue reads (and writes?)

### Optimizations:
- FPM - only trigger a RAS and multiple CASes
	- v1: can treat the memory as a combinational circuit (immediatly show data wrt CASes) `static`
	- v2: pulse cas without changing the column `nibble`

- EDO - extended data out
	- extend the time when data is valid (until next read)

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- so far we saw asynchronous RAMs (used RAS and CAS)

#### SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM 
Add a clock ⌚
- the RAS, CAS and so form together a `COMMAND` (read on rising edge)
- memory acts only on rising edge
Address:
- bank/row/colum
- bank = separate different memory fragments (big memories)
Data:
- 4 words are available at a read (sequentially)

Signals
|signal|meaning|
|-|-|
|CKE|enable the memory|
|CS||
|RAS|same|
|CAS|same|
|WE|same|
|DQM| collection of signals - activate parts of words available - useful especially for writing|

Commands table in the slides 🏓

#### DDRAM - Double data rate SDRAM
- still `synchronous`
- data transfer performed on both clock edges
	- commands are still processed on rising edge only

# DMA

> [!info] DMA = Direct Memory Access
> - transfer data from a peripheral to memory (and reverse) without the CPU's involvment
> - high speed data transfer

E.g. of peripherals:
- sound/image capture, SSD, CD-ROM

### DMA implementation
- a coprocessor that takes control to perform the data transfer with all it implies

### Minimum mode
- use the HOLD and HLDA pins of 8086
- after the HLDA is high the DMA controller does its job

### Maximum mode
- `RQ/GT` signals (request-grant)
- the same behavior as HOLD/HLDA but both requesting and granting are done using the same pin (request pulls pin `LOW` and processor pulls the pin `LOW` meaning grant and the third pull `LOW` is the release of the bus)
- there also is a bus controller that is able to suspend bus activities.

### DMA Sequence
- I/O wants data from memory (through Interface)

1. Interface issues a request to DMA controller
2. The DMA issues a HOLD to CPU
3. The CPU grants the HLDA => DMA takes over (bus master 👑)
4. DMA controller places an address on the bus (destined to memory) 
5. DMA sends ACK to Interface
6. Interface receives data from memory (thanks to ACK as well)
7. Data is latched
8. HOLD becomes 0
9. CPU takes over (HLDA = 0).

Finally, a word of data has been transferred between memory and I/O device

#### Specific DMA signals
> [!question] Why do we need IREQ if we have DREQ?

### DMA Transfer

#### Fly-By - useful
- controller issues command and data flows freely between MEM and IO

#### Flow-Through - not useful
- uses a READ anf a WRITE signal
- Data passes through the DMA controller (stores it internally)
- slower - somehow like a using the CPU for transfer

## DMA Controller 8237
- has a few channels (I/O - mem address pair) that are programmable (by the CPU)

### Internal structure
- byte count - cool

#### Channel
- base count - total nr of bytes to be transferred
- current count 
- base address - starting address 
- current address (incremented as the bytes come)

> [!info] We may need to transfer in a recurring manner
> - e.g. for image capture we may need to read again and again the same nr of bytes

### Pinout
Connection to peripherals
- req
- ack
- ior (bidirectional) as the controller is a peripheral for the CPU
- iow (bidirectional)

Connection to processor
- hold
- hlda
- cs - when active the controller is seen as a peripheral for the processor (can be programmed)
- addresses that select channels + data to be written

Connection to memory
- read
- write

Synchronizing and reset
- reset
- ready

Misc:
- AEN - global signal that blocks everyone from writing on the bus
- ADSTB - address strobe - (similar to ALE - Address Latch Enable) - performs multiplexing

### Internal structure takeaways
- add priority arbitration
- add timing control
- more registers for status/ and so


### How to connect it with the CPU system
Processes:
- Address bus creation (use `ALE` ) - stable after some mechanisms
- DMA address creation - have the same mechanisms as the prv. Use `ADSTB`
- `AEN` signal is used for BUS controller operation (connected to `OE` of address generation)
- Data issue 
- Commands generation - on Control bus deocder
- Handshake with peripheral


#### 16 bit address generation
- formed using 8 bits from DMA outputs and Data bus

#### 20 bit address generation
- DMA controller is limited to 16 bits so the remaining 4 bits come from an user program (can be configured through the peripherals)

#### Timing
- see diagram
- int and ext eop

#### Operating modes:
- inactive (processor has the bus and can write the controller)
- active (master)
	- individual transfer (byte by byte)
	- block transfer (hold the bus for more cycles)
	- transfer on req (transfer until EOP received)
- cascade them if desired using a 2 level system

#### Data transfer types
- dma write means I/O->memory
- read MEM->I/O
- test transfer
- memory to memory - use 2 channels (source and destination), use temporary register (the only use of `flow through type of transfer`) (possibly not available anymore)
- auto initialization - use the previous base count and address to re-do the same transfer.
