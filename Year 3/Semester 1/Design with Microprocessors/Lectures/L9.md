# DC Motor 🚤
- apply power and it turns
- more voltage -> faster return
- reverse polarity -> reverse direction

## Components

### Gearbox (reductor)
- slower turning but higher torque
- contains extra wheel 


### Sensor (Hall)
- see how fast the motor turns to control it
- the speed can't be controlled directly without it

#### How it works:
Have a wheel with a magnet and 2 sensors at 90 degree angle from each other

Hall sensor works like a transistor that 'opens' when the magnetic field approaches it
=> Output - binary signal

Therefore one sensor => speed (period of the digital signal ) shorter period, faster speed

Two sensors => add measurement of direction (one is regarded as clock and the other as data)
- check data value on rising edge of the clock


### Sensor (Perforated wheel - encoding)
- light emmiter and receiver is put on the two sides of the 

> [!question] How to tell the sense?
> - one solution: vary the size of the holes
> - use two wheels and 2 gates (E-R)  therefore we will have the same mechanism as in Hall (idea from the ball mouse)


### Motor

Use H bridge
- turn one way
- turn the other way
- brake
- short the power source 💀

Input: Voltage with polarity
- needs to be an external one (not Arduino)

Components:
- Digilent H bridge
- Driver L298 Dual H bridge
	- Power two motors
	- Power by the external supply (up to 12V) has a regulator

#### Coding practices
- use analog write for the h bridge inputs
	- Done to change the speed (proportional to the voltage) use PWM
- may get feedback from the motor

# Servo Motor 🧭

Points at specific angles provided by the user and try to hold the angles at the input signal

### Package
- Power+
- Power GND
- signal (Data)

Different fill factors of data signal determine the position of the output shaft - solved in `software`

> [!note] Signal data
>  Not suitable to work with analog write (we need much lower frequencies)

### Coding practices
- `Servo.h library`
- issue - the servo motors need only 5V, but the arduino 5V is not powerful enough (can't use `Vin` pin to power the servos)

> [!warning] To use more than 2 servos
> Use an external power source

### Servo class
- standard servo (use angle when writing)
- continuous rotating servo (uses speed when writing) (avoid them ⚠)

> [!important] Remarks
> - attach also sets the pin direction
> - must add a delay after writing for the servo to reach its state
> - `map` function converts the value from an interval to another one while preserving proportions

### Applications
- robot available in the lab

# Stepper motor 🚶‍♀️ 💸

- simplest motors use coils and magnetic fields
- doesn't turn freely, but expects control from each step

In reality the steppers are more complex than the presented initial model
- use a ferromagnetic device that allows precise rotation (teeth of the device)

### Stepper Library
- use 2 or 4 pils
- can step with a negative number (to reverse direction)

### Usage
- in junction with a dual H bridge pretty simple

# Relay
- big stuff

- Use relay boards in Arduino
	- interesting use a `optho-coulpler` - transistor opens up when itsss litt🔥
good idea to use an external power source

Command is completely separated from the high voltage coil switching
