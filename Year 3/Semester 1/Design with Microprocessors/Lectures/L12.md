# Memory Interfacing 2

- memory modules connected to a 16 bit bus

# RAM memory

## SRAM
- simpler from the interfacing pov
Characteristics:
	- from composition pov: A memory cell contains a Latch (feedback mechanism ensures that the bit keeps its value unless forced) 
	- the bit is always ready to be read
	- can read at the speed of the processor (access time is smaller)
	- expensive ++

Pinout:
	- special signals: CS, ReadEn (`G/OE`), WriteEn (`W/WE`) 

Schematic:
	- 8-bit bus
	- 32 kB blocks of SRAM organized in 8-module blocks (High block and Lower block - without this meaning tho) => 512 kB of RAM
> [!info] ðŸŒ³ think of memory as a tree, and the leaves are the bytes, smaller branches = modules, trunk = bus.

- seen by the CPU as a continuous CHUNK:
	- place address lines to each memory module (`A0 -> A14`)
	- decoders are placed in front of 8 chips - they get as input `A15-A17` 
	- the activation of a certain decoder is decided by `A18` introduced in another Decoder that uses 2 outputs
	- `A19` must be 0 in our case (we only access 2 decoders for the blocks)

```
if (IO/M == 0 && A19 == 0) {
	A18 up or down
	A17 - A15 - chip
	A0-A14 - select entry in chip
}
```

Other components:
- tranciever at the data bus
- buffers

> [!important] Buffers 
> - have the purpose of `AMPLIFIERS` but not like Voltage Amplifier, but Current Amplifiers because of `Fan-Out phenomenon` a.k.a. current may add up and the voltage drops (we need a voltage at a proper value to take effect on the memories).

For higher width data:
- writing must be handled especially => use `A0` and `BHE` logic when writing

### Drawing from scratch:
- buffers are implied
- use a 4 x 16 kB EEPROM (2^14 locations)
- use 8 x 32 kB SRAM (2^15 locations)
	- group them in pairs

- Address Lines - connection 
- Data Lines
- CS signals - linked between the two members of the pairs
- Decoders 
- Or gates for writing to EEPROM 
- Read enable (Active low) - propagates to all chips
- Write enable - necessary for SRAM only - `but` we need to take BHE and Write and combine using an `OR GATE` for High part and Write with A0 
- for safety when someone tries to access the unmapped memory addresses we can devise some logic to trigger an interrupt or so

## DRAM
- more concerned about connection
- memory cells  - one transistor - much less expensive
- issue: need to refresh data (stored in a capacitor)
	- need to isolate the capacitor from the bit lines when M1 transistor is closed
	- bit lines also have capacitor that interacts with the cell capacitor M1 is open therefore the charge of the BL capacitor is modified => the voltage is modified directly proportional to the current

Writing:
- next course
Reading:
- on the bit line use a 2.5V 
- sense amplifiers
- precharge the lines -> deactivate precharge -> connect cells to lines -> sense amp amplify difference between negative and positive charge

> [!info] Take a look at this once again (C12)
> - it explains why reading refreshes the data

Pinout:
- major change: column - matrix access (thanks to the higher capacity - and the fact that we don't want to add more pins => address is multiplexed)
- Special signals:
	- RAS - Row address Strobe (save row address in a buffer)
	- CAS - Column address Strobe (save col address in a buffer)
		- acts like a sel in a mux and gets a value that is already ready (thanks to precharging and RAS)
	- no CS anymore => the cs is `RAS = CAS = '1'`

Timing:
1. Present RAS = 1
2. Present CAS = 1
3. Present Row + fallingEdge RAS
4. Present Column + fallingEdge CAS
Some buffer times are added for the precharge and the  other components.

Refresh:
- there may be forgotten memory locations if we don't purposefully read everything at a certain interval

DRAM Controller `82C08`:
- irl applications - so that the user is not complicado
- capable of taking as input 18 address bits + generate 2 CAS, RAS + generate the output
- depicted in figure (pdf)
	- 4 256k x 8 DRAM chips
- the controller handles the whole process of sending the row and then the column
- `PE` - is needed to determine if we want to access the DRAM (span in the memory)
	- the PE and other control signals are generated using a PLA (more logic equations brought together
- diy version presented in pdf
	- an important component is a sequencer (introduce time delays)

After the holiday:
- one lecture for wrapping up
- one lecture for exercises
