3. Gardening system

## Options

## Robot

> [!info] Remote control (bluetooth) robot

Components (concepts):
- bluetooth
- dc motors and controller
- processing GUI
- analog signals

Extra stuff:
- hand motion control - cool
- find a purpose: bomb defuse/place, disinfect surfaces, pills dispenser

|Pro|Contra|
|-|-|
|multe concepte folosite|not so original|
|lots of online resources|scumpitz \$\$|

### Robotic arm with servo motors
- controlled through bluetooth?

## Smart gardening system

>[!info] Garden manager systems
>- gives the user (bluetooth) information regarding humidity, pH, luminosity, temperature and act on several motors for watering plants / shadowing the plant, 

|Pro|Contra|
|-|-|
|original|not so well documented|
||scumpitz \$\$\$|
|usability IRL|not so impactful|

Concepts used
- bluetooth 
- processing
- more sensors ig


## Worker safety system

> [!info] Helmet embedded with sensors and signals for unwanted conditions

Concepts:
- sensors mostly
- detect gas/light/proximity...
- some wearable device to detect pressure / levels of toxic gas

Main pro: - useful irl


### Bluetooth devices manager
- have a hub that manages multiple devices (speaker, door, ...) and set some routines
- e.g.: wake up - turn on the lights, play a relaxing tune, turn on the coffee machine, 


### Energy monitoring system
- similar to plant
- contain a thermostat + AC 
- switch off the based on the room luminosity, keep temperature constant

Not so unique.
