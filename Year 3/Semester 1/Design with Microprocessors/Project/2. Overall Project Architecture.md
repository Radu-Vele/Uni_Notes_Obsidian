# Program logic

## Organisation logic
- state machine (Is it the proper choice?)
- use interrupts (not busy waiting)

### Normal execution

```c
int state = 0; 
// 0 - no access - waiting for input
// 1 - someone is nearby => read RFID + PRINT LCD Welcome Message
// 2 - wait for input from: Keypad / RFID / Bluetooh
// 3 - Process input (activated by an Interrupt maybe) and act on servo
boolean adminMode = 0;
boolean openDoor = false; //determines writing 90 degree angle on servo
```
