# Program logic ðŸ§ 
 
## Organisation logic
- state machine-ish
- use interrupts (not busy waiting)

### Roles:

```mermaid
graph LR
Admin --> Access[Open the door using code - Get access with admin rights]
Admin --> Update[Add new card UID / Add new Allowed access code]
Admin --> Update1[Remove card / code]

User --> Access0[Use keypad code for access]
User --> Access1[Use card for access]
User --> Access2[Use bluetooth code for access]
```

# Modules of the project:

## Proximity Sensor + Keypad + RFID

> Integrate the keypad + RFID


- [x] Integrated LCD + RFID + Proximity
- [ ] Added Keypad
- [ ] Added EEPROM

### EEPROM
- store the current number of codes in an int at the beginning of the eeprom
- store the UIDs of users that have access (fixed len)
- retrieve the array from the eeprom at the beginning of the program execution
- save the array updated if there is the case

## Bluetooth "requests"

> Add the bluetooth logic on top of the f2f actions
