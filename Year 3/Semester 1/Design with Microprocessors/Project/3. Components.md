## ATMEGA
- 4kB of EEPROM

Available interfaces:
- 4 Hardware Serial Ports (UART) (PINs RX/TX: 19/18 17/16 15/14)
	- 1 x `Bluetooth`
	- 
- 1 I2C interface (PINs 20, 21)
	- 1 x `LCD Screen`
- 1 SPI interface (PINs 50, 51, 53, 53)
	- 1 x `RFID`

## RFID
#### Components:
- the tag (attached to card e.g.) have unique **UID**
	- You have 1024 bytes of data storage divided into 16 sectors and each sector is protected by two different keys, A and B.
- transmitter-receiver (2 way) - read/program (i2c connection)
	- send signal to tag and wait for response
- `SPI communication` MFRC522

#### Dependencies:
- rfid library MFRC522
- the library has lots of sample code

### Logic for basic functions:
- we can select a list of allowed UIDs and save it to EEPROM (Safe UID)
- we need to check if the UID of the card presented is safe and allow access
- we need to add functionality that takes a card and adds/removes them from the safe list

### Additional possible functions
- save data on the card (E.g. the number of access times in the building) and be able to show it on the LCD/Bluetooth


## EEPROM
- use EEPROM library
- at the beginning load from eeprom

Actions required related to it:
- load to a fixed-length string of passwords the ones saved to EEPROM

> [!important] To use global variables in other files you need to:
> - define them `int globalVal` in the `main.ino`
> - declare them `extern int globalVal` in the module `.h`


## LCD
- basic messages: "Authorized" "Access Denial"

## Bluetooth transmission
- basic mechanism send-receive messages:
- send command + password ""
- works by default, no stress. (HC-05, pass:1234)
