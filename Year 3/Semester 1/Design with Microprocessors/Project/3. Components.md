#### ATMEGA
- 4kB of EEPROM

### RFID
#### Components:
- the tag (attached to card e.g.) have unique **UID**
	- You have 1024 bytes of data storage divided into 16 sectors and each sector is protected by two different keys, A and B.
- transmitter-receiver (2 way) - read/program (i2c connection)
	- send signal to tag and wait for response
- SPI communication MFRC522

#### Dependencies:
- rfid library


### EEPROM
- use EEPROM library
- at the beginning load from eeprom

Actions required related to it:
- load to a fixed-length string of passwords the ones saved to EEPROM

### LCD
- basic messages: "Authorized" "Access Denial"
