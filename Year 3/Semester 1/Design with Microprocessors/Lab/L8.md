# To Do

Individual work:
1. Run the examples in this lab work.
2. Change example 2 to reset the graph once the the end of the screen is reached.
3. Optional, instead of 2: change example 2 so that the graph will scroll continuously towards
the left when it becomes full.
4. Add the temperature graph text information. Use the function text (text_to_display, x, y),
where x is the horizontal coordinate, and y the vertical coordinate. Display the text
information at a time interval that will ensure the texts will not overlap.
5. Change Example 3 (Arduino and Processing code) in order to control the state of some
LEDs from the graphical user interface. Connect to Arduino a LED module. In Processing,
add four buttons to the graphical interface. When pressing a button in the Processing
program, the state of the corresponding LED connected to Arduino will change.
6. Use the “keyboard” functions of Processing to read keys. Display the pressed key in the
Processing console, but also on the Arduino LCD.
