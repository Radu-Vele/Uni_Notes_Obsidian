# Communication

# Reading material takeaways

## Types of communication

1. Serial
	- send only one bit at a time
	- 1 $\to$ 4 wires
	- **Synchronous** (SPI/I2C)
	- **Asynchronous** (UART)
2. Parallel
	- use buses to transfer more bits at  a time (8/16/...)
	- synchronized by a clock (send-receive)
	- not really our focus for Arduino

## UART

- so far we've only printed on it
- now it's time to read from the PC using UART

### Elements of transmission:
- Baud rate (bps) - speed of data transmission
- Data Packet - contains data to be trasmitted (probably a byte) + sync (Start/Stop) + Parity

|Start|Data|Parity|Stop|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|5 $\to$ 9|0 $\to$ 1|1 $\to$ 2|

- Data bits (chunk)
	- data bits (called character)
	- attention to the endianess

> [!Important] Endianess
> Little Endian = The LSB is at a **lower** address (LSB Transmitted first)
> Big Endian = The LSB is at a **higher** address (MSB Transmitted last)

- Sync bits
	- start = begin packet `0`
	- stop = end packet `1`
- Parity bits
	- role in error control

$$Parity_{bit} = d_{n - 1} \oplus ... \oplus d_0 \oplus 0(even)\text{ or }1(odd)$$
- Data line (1 by default)

### UART structure
- GND
- RX - receive data (ino pin0) $\Leftarrow$
- TX - transmit data (ino pin1) $\Rightarrow$

### Arduino support
- `Serial` library
- functions described in lab

```c
// Setup: Board, cable, lcd

//include LCD library
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

String inputString = "";// create an empty string to hold the incoming serial data

// Boolean flag to test whether a complete string has been received (enter pressed in serial monitor)

boolean stringComplete = false;
LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);

void setup() {
	// initialize serial interface
	Serial.begin(9600); // implicit serial frame format
	//initialize lcd
	lcd.begin(16, 2);
	// reserve 200 bytes for the string
	inputString.reserve(200);
}

void loop() {
	// display the string when new line is received
	if (stringComplete) {
		lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
		lcd.print(inputString);
		Serial.println(inputString);
		// empty the string
		inputString = "";
		// reset the flag
		stringComplete = false;
	}
}

/*
SerialEvent is called when new data is received on the RX port
This function is automatically called when the loop is called.
If we add delays in loop we will also delay the showing of the
result??? */
void serialEvent() {
	while (Serial.available()) {
		// read the new received byte
		char inChar = (char)Serial.read();
		// check if new line character has been received; if
		//not, add it to the string
		// we do not add new line in input string since it
		//will show an extra character in the LCD
		if (inChar != '\n')
			inputString += inChar;
		// dif the receive character is new line, set the flag
		//so that the loop will know to display
		//the received data
		if (inChar == '\n') {
			stringComplete = true;
		}
	}
}
```

Setup from PC:
- baud rate
- terminal character `\n

## I2C (Inter-Integrated circuit protocol) 🏦

- work in pairs 
- make sure to use common ground

---
- master-slave principle
- short distance
- communication can be made between 2 or **more** devicesz
- synchronized

### Structure:
- SCL - clock (master generates it, but slaves can manipulate it to low `clock stretching`) (Arduino `PIN 21`)
- SDA - data (Arduino `PIN 20`)

> [!question] Open drain communication
> What does it mean?

### Communication
START:
- SCL = HIGH and SDA = LOW 

Address frame
	- master selects the destination
	-  MSB first then R(1)/W(0) bit
	- ACK/NACK bit `What?`

- Receiving device: if data has reached it (9 bits) it pulls SDA to LOW

Data frame
	- a byte information
	- put to SDA while SCL=LOW
	- sync by the master clock

STOP:
- Master signals it: SCL goes from 0 to 1 and stays HIGH, then SDA is sent from 0 to 1

> [!Note] That is why during data transmission, the SDA changes only when SCL is 0

### Example
- communicate between 2 arduino boards
- use `wire` library - abstraction over all other hardware detalis

```c
/* SLAVE */

#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
// include I2C library
#include <Wire.h>

int x = 0;
LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);

void setup() {
	// Start i2C slave at address 9
	Wire.begin(9);
	// attach a function to be called when we receive
	//something on the I2C bus
	Wire.onReceive(receiveEvent);
	lcd.begin(16,2);
	lcd.print("Slave");
}

void receiveEvent(int bytes) {
	x = Wire.read(); //read I2C received character
}

void loop() {
	lcd.setCursor(0,1); // display received character
	lcd.print(x);
}
```

```c
/* MASTER */
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
// include I2C library
#include <Wire.h>

LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);
int x = 0;

void setup() {
	// Open I2C bus as master
	Wire.begin(); //wire nr?
	lcd.begin(16,2);
	lcd.print("Master");
}

void loop() {
	Wire.beginTransmission(9); // transmit to device #9
	Wire.write(x); // transmit x
	Wire.endTransmission(); // stop transmission
	lcd.setCursor(0,1); // display sent character on LCD
	lcd.print(x);
	x++; // increment x
	
	if (x > 5) x = 0; // reset x when it reaches 6
	
	delay(500);
}
```

### Extension:
- create a network of boards using i2c

# Lab Work
- bidirectional communication: more tricky
	- to avoid callbacks we can use the `begin()` with parameters, both master and slave can use the same address. 
	- can alternate the position of master between the board
		- at string complete, the receiver board becomes master and writes to the other board, then `endTransmission()` and re-become slave
		- identical code for both boards.
