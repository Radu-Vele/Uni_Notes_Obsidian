# I/O modules applications

### Jump over the SSD

## Our focus: use the learning shield

Remarks:
- make sure the shield PINs match the board's ones
- the shield PINs might make contact with the socket so make sure not to push `way` too hard 

### Shield:
- buttons
- LEDs
- 7 segment display

### 7 segment recap:
- each segment is connected to an LED
	- one way: common Cathode signal (active low) , Anodes (active high)
	- another way: common Anode (active high) and activate each segment by writing the cathodes (our case) (active low segments)

- Implementation: use a LuT (can switch between the two ways above by negating)
- Code: 
```
activate anode1 send cathode1 
break 
activate anode2 send cathode 2


the On/Off process is done 50Hz Refresh Rate (eye sees as stable)

```

- in our case we will use a shift register
	- one for cathodes (a is the LSB g is the MSB)
	- one for the anodes (A1 is MSB)
	- the registers are cascaded => cathodes are written to R1 and then sent to R2 after 8 clk cycles

Pin 8 - bit by bit data transmission
Pin 7 - clk
Pin 4 - active low enable

The analog pins can be read as digital 

## ToDo:
- [ ] run examples
- [ ] self learning
- [ ] make a function that takes an int and gives the array format for displaying it on the SSD
	- tip: use / and %
	- [x] done
- [ ] create a chronometer
	- initial state is 0 wait for the stop
	- might need to add a Debouncer or use interrupts?
