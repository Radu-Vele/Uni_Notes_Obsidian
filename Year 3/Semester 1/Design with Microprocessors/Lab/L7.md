# Analog Input Signals

> [!note] Test Approach:
> - try to solve problems for each lab and write code

## Temperature sensor
- send temperature as Voltage (0.01V per Celsius Degree)
- to measure analog voltage we need to connect it to an analog pin (A0...A15)
- Voltage upper limit = 5V
- if we want positive degrees only we must subtract 0.5 from read voltage

### Coding

```c
//Reading an analog signal
analogRead(A0); //returns n in {0, 1023} interval
//to transform n to voltage use regula D3Simple
v_in = (n * 5)/1024; //5 as in 5V
```

### Other analog sources
- Bricks:
	- GND
	- VCC
	- Out - connect to our circuit
- Light Sensor:
	- not clear definition between light intensity and voltage, just directly proportional
	- use phototransistor
- Potentiometer
	- Used as input
	- can be treated as a variable resistor
	- link one end to GND and one to VCC and place the Vout in the desired position => Voltage divider

- Materials:
	- learning shields
	- cables
	- temperature sensors
	- potentiometer

## Register roles ADC...

1 ADC is featured on board - that brings some issues and the need for selection

### ADMUX
- selection register that **chooses which analog in pin to use in ADC**
- the mux is an analog mux
- in some cases we can select multiple inputs / add amplification, etc.

Reference Voltage:
- is selected from ADMUX as well (Default is VCC)
```c
analogReference(DEFAULT); //specify reference
```

`ADLAR` bit determines how the following two ones are used

### ADCSRA
- we have 3 bits APS - prescaller register
- conversion usually takes 12 clock cycles and the speed of the clock is sleected using the prescaller bits
- ADSC - start conversion, stays on 1 until the conversion is done

### ADCL/ADCH
- result of the converter LOW and HIGH combined by the compiler
- 

## To Do
- tasks in lab work

> [!warning] Task 4 is modified
> instead of calibration, make a thermostat - ish
> Give a goal and try to reach that goal temperature
