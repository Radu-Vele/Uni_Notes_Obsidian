# Various advanced subjects
## Fog
- need to map it to the skyBox as well
	- to solve it we need to send to the shader the fog color and combine the skyBox color with the fog color

## Remove some info from the scene
- define transparent objects (process them last s.t. when their color is computed we have the color of the objects behind them)
