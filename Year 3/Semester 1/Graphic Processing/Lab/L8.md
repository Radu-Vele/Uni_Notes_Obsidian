# Phong Model

- We will specify the light position
	- light direction - computed for each fragment
		- normalize(lightposition(incameraSpace)-fragmentposition)

### Specular
- use reflection vector
	- add attenuation component (fade based on distance between light source and object


# Project
> [!important] To Do until last week

## To Do
- Implement using positional
- change specular
- add attenuation
- sample color from texture map
