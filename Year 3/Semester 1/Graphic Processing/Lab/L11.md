# Cubemap

Purpose: include our scene of objects inside this cube

Also can define reflective objects

### Tutorial:
- already implemented

### Can start from the project core 
- try to implement cube maps inside the project core
- implement a 3D scene of objects (defined either in `OpenGL` - specify a sequence of transformations for each objects to put them in the final location, or in `Blender` and then export it - the entire one- for the fixed objects, the ones we need to animate need to be exported separately)
