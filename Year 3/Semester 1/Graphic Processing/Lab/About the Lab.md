Goal: 3D graphical apps using OpenGL library implementation

- moodle-based

## Resources:
- VS project with infrastructure
- pdf with theory, assignments

## What we have to do:
- project that looks like a game ish

- get at least 5 points (Project with all studied concepts 70% (needs to be $>5$) + Quiz at the end of the semester 30%) 

## Structure
- how to define modules from the pipeline
- 3D transformations (scaling, ...)
- additional elements: light sources (directional/point), shadow computation
- project implementation
