# Phong Reflection Model
- elements:
	- light source
		- directional
		- position
	- direct illumination
	- indirect illumination

We compute color based on these elements

## Division between components

### Ambient
$$C_{ambient} = K_{ambient}*C_{Light}*C_{object}$$

### Diffuse
- define rough surfaces

$$C_{diffuse}=C_{light}*...$$
- taken into consideration the angle between light source and normal

### Specular
- shiny objects ‚ú®
- use color of light source
- compute cosine between reflecting vector and viewing direction

## Color computation

$$C_{phong}=$$

## Implementation
- in the vertex stage
- compute each vertex color
- in rasterization, fragment color is computer through interpolation of colors of vertices


- in fragment shader may copy all formulas but we would need to pass data between vert sh and frag sh (much data)


Computation is done in camera space. Cam location is (0, 0, 0)


## To Do:
- steps in tutorial üë®‚Äçüíª 
	- 1st archive - files for the tutorial
	- assignment: implement the phong reflection model in the fragment shader (2nd archive)
		`copy all lines of codes implemented in the vertex shader & pass additional data to the framgent shader to access normal vector, viewing direction, ...`
	- Implement at home, for the project

Next:
- positional lab source
- then, shadow computation
