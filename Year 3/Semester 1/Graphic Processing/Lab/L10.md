# GP - Shadow computation


Blender tip:
- export the model for the landscape (static stuff)
- export the animated objects separately (treat them separately)
	- careful about the origin of the scene of objects (object that rotate and stuff will need to be translated to the origin of the system)

Resources:
- use blender images
- download stuff - careful to have them working (textures, coordinates specifications)
