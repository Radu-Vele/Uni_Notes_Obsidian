# Shadow computation

- occlusion (shadow source) is not normally integrated in the rasterization pipeline
- implement a shadow computation algorithm (shadow mapping) in our lab

2 stages

- 1. Light source pov (a new camera with the parameters of the light source) and check the parts of the object that are visible (compute Z-coordinate for each point - apply projection matrix * cam light * model matrix * initial coordinates)
- 2. Camera pov - 
	- identify for each fragment the mapped point from the object
	- check if points visible from cam pov are visible from light pov
		- compute the color of that point using ambient + diffuse + specular
		- for others just use the ambient component
		- need to transform the coordinate systems from viewing direction to light direction

### Resource
- starting project moodle
- algorithm description in pdf
- source code to modify => visualize the 3d objects and the shadows computed
