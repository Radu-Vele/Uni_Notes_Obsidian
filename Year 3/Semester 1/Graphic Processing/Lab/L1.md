# Laboratory 1

## Graphics pipeline
- contains some mandatory and non-mandatory components
- Vertex shader + Fragment shader (necessary)

## Today:
- read pdf
- mathematics GLM recap 

## TODO:
- [ ] 1. compute the location of a point after transformations
- [ ] 2. compute the angle between vectors (Dot product)
- [ ] check if 2D polygon is convex / not (Cross product) - need to transform to 3D to be able to apply the cross product $\Rightarrow$ a normal vector, and depending of the signs we decide (all are positive => convex, at least one negative $\Rightarrow$ concave)
- [ ] improve the convex algorithm
- [ ] normal vectors for each edge are computed using the cross product

First create an Empty VS C++ empty project, then add the resource files to the project
