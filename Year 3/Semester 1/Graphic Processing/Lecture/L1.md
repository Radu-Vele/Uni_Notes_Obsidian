### Coordinate systems

## Points
- vectors = difference of points

## Lines
- slope equation
$$y = mx+b$$
$$m=\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
- Parametric equation
	$$P(t)= P_1 + t(P_2 - P_1)$$
	- contribution of each point
	- application: viewing line
	- used to determine the position of points 

	$$\begin{cases}
	t < 0 & \text{point not on the line "before"}\\
	t = 0 & \text{the } P_1 \text{ point}\\
	t > 0 & \text{point on the line}\\
	t = 1 & \text{the } P_2 \text{ point}\\
	t > 1 & \text{point "after" the line}
	\end{cases}$$
- integrated in formulas: length, ...

## Vectors
Defined by two points
- operations

### Dot product
Result is a scalar
We care about the sign and the absolute value

$$u \cdot v = u_xv_x + u_yv_y + u_zv_z$$
$$u \cdot v = |u| * |v| * cost(\theta)$$

**Information about:**
- relative position of 2 vectors
- angle between vectors (orthogonality, measurement, )
- position of point against a plane
- module of projection of a vector onto another (computation is not graphical)
- compute whether 2 entities will collide (use vectors / plane)

### Cross product
**Result**: vector perpendiculat to the plane determined by the 2 opperands

$$\vec{v} = \vec{v_1} \times \vec{v_2} = n * |\vec{v_1}| * |\vec{v_1}| * sin(\theta)$$

Use the right hand rule to determine the direction

Computation ways:
- formula
- matrices

**Information** about:
- front face of a plane (cross product of consecutive edges) (inside: cross product point to me) - counterclockwise definition of vertices determines it
- triangle computation exactly $\frac{1}{2}$ of that formula
- polygon area (useful)

$$\sum{}{}{(...)}$$


### Combo dot and cross product:
- Example: Check if an object is in front of me  / left / right
	- if I want front / back (use dot product & direction of view vector)
	- if I want left / right (use cross product and the direction of view vector)
	- concave/convex polygon (use cross products of succesive edges, must have the **same sign**)
	- distance of point to line (in plane / in space)

## Planes
Defined by **equations**:
	- of 3 points (determinant)
	- one point and normal vector (dot product)
	- dot product of two vectors with D added as distance from Plane to xOy
	- parametric equation as relationship between 2 lines
	$$A(t, s) = (1 - s) ((1 - t)P + tQ) + SR$$

## Applications

### Point to point relationship
- clockwise or counterclk
- computation using determinant

$$D = \begin{vmatrix} 
x1 & y1 & 1 \\
x2 & y2 & 1 \\
x3 & y3 & 1
 \end{vmatrix}$$

$\Rightarrow$ position of point w.r.t triangle (orientation of triangles determined by $\triangle$ vertices and the point)

### Point to Polygon relationship
- polygon triangulation algorithm (uses the point to triangle relationship)
- Delaunay triangulation (used in mechanics & CAD) - can split heterogeneous shapes into maps of triangles

### Point to 3D convex object
- use faces of the object

### Polyhedrons
$V - E + F = 2$

### Line to triangle relationship
- Cyrus-Beck üôÉ for convex
	- also applies to covex 3D objects




# OpenGL

- useful resources kept in moodle [Open GL Website](http://opengl.org) , [Algorithms](http://opengl-redbook.com)

- obeys the:

## Graphics rendering pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR

Vectorial_Represented_Object-->O[Operations...]-->Pixel_image
```
- additional attributes: light sources, shadows, intensity

### Operations in pipeline:
- clipping
- hide back edges (Hidden parts removal)
- project on screen
- normalization of space (0, 1) $\Rightarrow$ virtual scene of objects (objects are in orthogonal projection)
- vector $\to$ raster (Fragments - projected to screen as pixels available in the **VideoBuffer** memory)
