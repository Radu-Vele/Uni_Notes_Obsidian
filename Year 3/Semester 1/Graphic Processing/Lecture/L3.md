# Hidden Line and surface Removal 🐇

Previous course went with algorithms until area subdivision

### Why?
- create a photorealistic scene of objects
- don't waste resources on non-visible parts of the immage

Principles
- sort primitives and render from far to close

## Sorting:
- is sped up as there are so many elements to be taken into account

### Coherence: 
> inherit the same property from previous iterations (don't spend additional time on computation)

- differnet types depending on context

e.g. in the slides:
	- non intersection property
	- face coherence - property has linear variation
	- line / edge coherence

### Depth sort: 
> use appropriate projection (perspective/🌟**orthogonal** - avoid * of real numbers)

- choose orthogonal projection for fast computatuin
-  shapes ar modified through projection but eventually the image on the screen is the same

### Consider 2D and 3D extensions 
- perform operations on extensions (rectangles in 2D, parallelipipeds in 3D)

## Floating Horizon Algorithm
- mathematical method - use plane equations 
- get a set of curves that are sorted and rendered from back to front

## Back-face culling
- define the front face or back face of polygones
- use the normal vectors
	- normal vector vs the vector of the relative position of the plane to the viewer
	- dot product is used
- choose only front faces
- efficient but works `only for convex object`
- Up to 2 x performance (half of the faces are hidden)

Sometimes the face is not wholly visible so the algorithm doesn't work well there

## Area subdivisison algorithms
- divide the polygones in smaller ones that are further compared (even go down to pixel level)
- introduced in graphics systems as standard approaches (starting from Phd in 60s, 70s)

### Warnock 
- divide the polygone in smaller ones
- multiple cases

- eventually get to small squares that we need to fit to one of our case

### Weiler-Atherton
- performant
- have z coordinates (1 max 0 min)
- choose one polygone as clipping polygon
	- build two lists: inside (polygones intersection) / outside
	- analyze inside lists - compute if behind or in front of A 
	- only one polygone in the list => print it 
	- get to a better candidate for polygon clipping -> start again with that one 
		- analyze internal list
		- analyze external list

- display all visible polygones

### Catmull
- for curver surfaces
- surfaces are divided to patches and projected to plane. The projection is compared to a pixel

## Depth Buffer
- z-buffer algorithm
- fill buffer with the depth value of polygon
- z smaller => closer to viewer
- polygones can be processed in any order (solve the issue of searching in a list of shapes 💸)

- analyze scan line x scan line (pixels). The big distances are initialized with $\infty$.
	- if current distance is smaller than existing value in buffer, keep smaller value

Output: the buffer contains pixels colored according to the distance from viewers

Disadvantage: need for a buffer (maybe with floating point numers)

How to use coherence to speed things up 🚄:
- compute the z for the next pixel based on the current one (expensive)
	- coherence can speed it up: compute next z by adding a constant to the previous z (see equations in slides)

## Depth Sorting Algorithm
- painter's algorithm
- same theoretical approach as before (sort $\to$ solve ambiguities $\to$ display)

### Approach
- list polygones and sort by z
- compare current with all the rest, if current farther than all, keep it there, else leave it behind
	- multiple cases (tests) that involve if user and one of the polygon are in the same plane
	- if tests fail, swap the polygons
	- if still fail, clip the polygons  and take the process again
