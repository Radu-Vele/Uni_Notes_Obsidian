# OpenGL

- how it works
- graphic rendering pipeline

> Client-Server architecture

## The data
- is stored in Buffer objects
- drawing = transfer data to OpenGL server

Steps to build the image:

### Vertex shading
- shaders compute properties for vertices (position, color, ...)
- only a shader can be active at a time

### Tessellation shading
- descrbies shape using many triangles/polygons (like patchwork)

### Geometric shading

### Primitive assembly
- organize vertices into geometric primitives (lines, triangles, ...)

### Clipping
- automatically handled by OpenGL


### Rasterization
- get pixels (fragments)

### Fragment shading
- programmer can set color, depth, texture mapping
- outcome: pixels stored in framebuffer

> [!note] Framebuffer
> - represented by memory that holds the data about the pixels that is fed to the display


## Programming levels
- libraries
- toolkits
- multimedia libraries (Qt e.g.)
