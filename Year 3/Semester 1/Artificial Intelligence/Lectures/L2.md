# Lecture 2: Searching

The solution to any issue for which there is a state space

Not really our purpose, but fundamental

## Problem solving agents
- the same types from the previous lecture apply

Goal-based

### Simple problem solving agents
for Single state problems
- based on:
- define **goal**, define **problem**, fing sequence of **actions** by searching, **act**, deal with the **remainder**

- problem: initial **test**, **goal** test, path **cost**

e.g: various games

> [!NOTE] State space
> all reachable states form this set
> - needed for formulating an algorithm

### How to add abstraction to the state space
- maybe a graph

Examples: 8-Queens problem, 8-puzzle

- finding the number of states

### Tree Search
- the states graph is a tree 

```
/*
* Algorithm
* at each step choose a leaf node for expansion and check if solution
* otherwise expand
* until no expansion / goal found
*/
```

- each state is represented by a node (abstraction) 

### Search strategy
- defines how the expansion is performed
- measure complexiry using branching factor, depth, maximum depth of state space

### a. Uninformed (info available in the problem definition)
- BFS ($O(b^{d+1})$)
		- combinatorial explosion (really bad)
		- **Uniform-cost search**
		- Use a Queue
		- It has completness
- DFS
		- extension: Depth-limited Search
- Iterative Deepening Search
		- go on incremented depth
- bidirectional Search:
		- 2 searches simultaneously
		- less complexity


**Issue**:
- need to detect **repeated states**

###  b. Informed  (heuristic) - have additional information

## Graph search
- visited states kept in a list `closed`
- you need to check if the node is not in closed

A few assumptions are made regardning the environment

- Partial information
-  Single State Problem


# Best-First Search

- Solve the limitation of uninformed search

## Heuristics

- he goes through multiple slides sets
- use textbook to understand concepts
