# AI 101

## What is AI
- lots of abstractions and models 
- Rationality vs Human-like intelligence

### Key concepts:
- Theory of Mind
- Logic $\to$ Logic programming
- Turing test $\to$ Imitation Game
- First Order Logic, Description Logic
- Explainability

$Phylosophy + Maths + Psychology + Economics$
$+ Linguistics + Neuroscience + Control Theory \to AI$

### Subdisciplines:
- NLP, ML, Computer Vision, etc.

### AI milestones
- Artificial Neurons
- Neural Network Computers
- Chess Algorithms (Shannon, Turing)
- John McCarthy (AI Term in 1950s)
- various new Visions

### AI Trends
- computation power exploitations
- Narrow AI (task-specific)
- Natural Language

## Other stuff we will study
- described in the ai22.html 


# Agents

**Goal**: Intelligent agents design ðŸ§ 

Example: The Vacuum Cleaner World
	- Rational agent (Clear, performant)
	- Performance Measure **Focus on the environment not the desired agent**
	- Rational $\ne$ Successful 

> [!note] **PEAS**
> Define what is rational
> - **P**erformance
> - **E**nvironment
> - **A**ctuactors
> - **S**ensors

Agent function
	- How to program agents and trade-offs

Types of Agents:
	- Simple Reflex agent (no history taken into consideration)
	- Model-based Reflex Agent (better observability of environment)
	- Goal-based Agent (get to the desirable state by analyzing consequences)
	- Utility-based Agent (moves next by also analyzing the utility of the future state - happiness based ðŸ˜„)
		- Utility: Map state $\to$ number

### **Learning**
- Helps acquiring prodrams
- Elements:
	- Performance
	- Critic
	- Learning Element
	- Problem generator
