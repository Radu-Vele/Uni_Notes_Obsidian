# Laboratory 1

## Use linux exercise
- checkout the compilation using Makefiles
- **ssh** connections, **scp** usage

## Python
- recap in Appendix

## Pacman
- use code to control pacman and win üèÜ 
- make use of the commands in commands.txt using our desired commands
- we need to solve the know issues (didn't remember those)
- we will modify search.py  to add our implementations of the code

```python
#comment three prints in DFS
```

- can use pycharm if wanted

### Code directory contents
To be modified:
- search.py 
- searchAgents.py - searching classes

Others:
- pacman.py - main


## TODO:
- Make sure you set up the environment (either WSL or VM or dual-boot)
- Alternatively try using python2 on wsl
- Find out how to use the Display from WSL
- Next we will implement some algorithms

## Solution for running tkinter from WSL

Prerequisites:
	- XLaunch server 

1. Launch server, allow all connections
2. If the wsl doesn't automatically detect the display write
`export DISPLAY=<ip-addr-of-wsl-found-from-ps:ipconfig>:0.0`
