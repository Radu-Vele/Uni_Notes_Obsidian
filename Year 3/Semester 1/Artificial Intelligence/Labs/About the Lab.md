# About the Lab

## Organization

 ### Three parts:
 - Searching (with Pac-man)
	 - Based on AI, not DFS, BFS, but heuristic Algorithms (A-star)
- Theorem proof (used in practice for debugging)
- Schedulers (robots with init state, goals, actions)
	- build plans (on steps

Moodle based: AI2022Oct!

Documentations to be written in $\LaTeX$
- latex template on moodle (use Overleaf)
- gradually add documentation

## Use linux exercise
- checkout the compilation using Makefiles
- **ssh** connections, **scp** usage

## Python


## Pacman
- use code to control pacman
- make use of the commands in commands.txt using our desired commands
- we need to solve the know issues (didn't remember those)
- we will modify search.py  to add our implementations of the code

```python
#comment three prints in DFS
```

## TODO:
- Make sure you set up the environment (either WSL or VM or dual-boot)
- Alternatively try using python2 on wsl
- Find out how to use the Display from WSL
- Next we will implement some algorithms
