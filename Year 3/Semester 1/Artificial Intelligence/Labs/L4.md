# Adversarial search

Concepts:
- multi-agent environment (pacman, ghosts)
- evaluation functions
- MINIMAX Algorithm
- Alpha-beta pruning

Resources:
- download multiagent framework - I have it apparently

## Reflex agent
- choose random action at each step (in order to improve its score)
- Functions:
	`getAction()`
	`evaluationFunction()`
	`scoreEvaluationFunction()`

> [!Question] Question
>  How is this different from UCS?


## Minimax algorithm
- novel element: other agents plan against our agent ðŸ˜ˆ $\Rightarrow$ Adversarial search

- use a **Game Tree** that includes MAX actions and in response MIN actions
- e.g. in chess
- the whole game search space is generated (big)

> [!Question] Pay attention to the in-class explanation
> Did you get it?

- use CUTOFF tests and heuristics

```
Desired position: 
	- function that eval the pos
		Args: dist_psc_ghosts, dist_pac_food
		f() <= dist_ghosts (max) * pondere, dist_food (min)

- ghost minimizes (choose min punctaj


Tree:
- un nivel pacman
- un nivel ghost
```


## Alpha-beta Pruning
- improve the previous solution by reducing the game states from the tree
$$\alpha=MAX(\text{choices at any choice point along MAX path})$$
$$\beta=MIN(\text{choices along the MIN path})$$
```

```

- another algorithm

## TODO:

- Assignment work:
	- choose an example from moodle
	- E.g. choose a search algorithm, 8-puzzle
	- create a new problem
	- choose heuristics for our problem
