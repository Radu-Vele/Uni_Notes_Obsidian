# First Order Logic

## Add-ons
- variables - instance 
- constants 
- Predicates - T/F - can be applied logical operators
- Functions - can be composed
- quantifiers: `forall` 

## Variables
- for all / exists quantifiers - the order `matters`
- when we write a function we need to specify quantifiers

```
Romeo and Juliet are in love
---
E x love (R, x)
E y love (J, y)
```

Exercise - How many relations for 4 individuals
`mace4 -n 4 -m -1 -f`

```
exists x love(R, x)
exists y love(J, y)
```

How does mace4 make it
- have a matrix that has rows and cols all 
- eliminate

Also we can filter the variables. `isofilter`
