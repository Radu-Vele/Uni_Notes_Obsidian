# Minefield game
- navigate with arrows
- demonstrate there is no mine

`mine(x, y) - there is a mine `

```
* 
- 6 4 mine - for sure
- no mine on line 1
- equivalent there s a mine on col 1, row x | there is a mine on col x row 
- if there s a mine on row x col 3 then | there is a mine row x col 8
- no mine on diagonal
- if there is a mine on row x y then there is no mine on x z proved y diff z
- either mine on 3 5 or 5 3
- if mine(6, y) 
- and ^ (no mine on 2 3) (no mine on 3 2)
- and (mine 4 2)(mine 5 7)
```

```
Constraints (reduce the backtracking by contstraint propagation):
D + E = Y + 10 * Carry
M = 1 
S belongs to {8, 9}
O belongs to {0, 1} -> 0
N = E + 1
E [2.. 7]
N [3.. 8]
```

_ 0
_ 1
_ 2
_ 3

_ 9

Make sure the proposition is true
```assumptions and constraints
- must have at least one of any of them
- need to be careful about 2 digit numbers
- 
```

### Prover9 reminder
- variables (u,v,...)
- quantifiers (all, exists)
- functions - can be composed, operated on
- predicates with logical operators (and, or, implication, equivalence)

#### Sudoku
- 2 constraints (unique value on row)

#### Ruler 0 -> 6 Coulomb Ruler
- place 2 pointers to be able to measure all values from 1 to 6
- use case: placement of measurement systems, place walls in a conference room
	- 0 -> 100 and 3 walls
