# Laboratory 2 Uninformed Search

# Reading Material Takeaways

> Goal: Pacman finds the food through uninformed search (DFS, BFS)

## Searching the food

The problem details:
- options: N/S/E/W
- solution: sequence of actions for pacman (returned form functions  in search.py)
- state space: (x, y) positions for the full board

### Search problem:
- initial state
- possible actions
- transition model (next state)
- goal test
- path cost

### Random Search Agent

### DFS and BFS
- [ ] Implement DFS
	- [x] done
- [ ] Implement BFS
	- [x] done
- [ ] Implement Uninformed Search

# Lab work
1. Get familiar with pacman
2. Implement the searching algorithms
	Helper Functions in search.py
	Use stack / queue.
	Implement the random search using random

TODO
- have dfs, bfs, random done
- look at uniform search
