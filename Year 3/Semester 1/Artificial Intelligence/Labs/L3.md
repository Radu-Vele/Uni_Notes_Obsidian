# Informed Search

## Reading Material Takeaways

### A* algorithm

Is a best-first search (based on an evaluation function = estimation of the real cost) algorithm

$$f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$$ with h being a **heuristic**

How to choose heuristics?
- in Pac-man use the Euclidian and Manhattan Distance between positions

Example: Use Mahnattan Distance as heuristic


### Propose heuristics for 2 other problems

1. Find all Corners
2. Eat all food dots


## In-class explanations

Introduce different costs

### Uniform cost search
Prtiority Queue
- dont forget that costs add up
- go up from the BFS by changing the PQ

Dont bother that much

### Informed searching
- use heuristic

### Greedy

### A*

### Modify Problem
- implement needed functions (in CornersProblem)

## Todo
- Implement the A* search algorithm
	- use Manhattan Distance as heuristic
