### Project:

**Deadlines**:
1. Mini-project **Hello World** for a SaaS application **1st November**
	- program accessed from web endpoints
	- described in book saasbook.info (**first 4 chapters**) (written in ruby but we don't need to actually learn it) (follow that architecture)
	- 1 project/team or can do it by myself
	- can use any of Java&Spring/Python&Django/Ruby&Rails
	- max 8 membri (2, 3, e ok)
	- MVC
	- e.g. Spring **MVC** Web

2. Final project **15th November (before it)**
	- Choose Team + Theme + Technologies
	- Use cases (functions of project) + Use case model to be specified
	- Setup the project extending the SaaS project to be suitable

3. Final project delivery **Week 13 (for documentation)**
	- documentation and executabes

	- can follow the book or various tools:
		- PRISM Case studies + model checkers 
			- UML modelling is extended with verification of the model
			- Verify programs automatically (all possible execution) 
			- Inspiration sources on the website
		- Session Types (app-level protocol that is verified at compile-time) 
			- we can **debug** distributed programs at compile-time (better than testing)
		- Run-time verification (K Framework)
			- big state-space
		- Model checkers (state space explosion issue)
		- Theorem provers (Coq) (prove the properties of the program) e.g. Verifiable C, book Software Foundations.
		- AI / Machine Learning / Heuristics based methods:
			- No guarantees tho

- we can improve the executable from W13 to W14
