> System that displays and processes information about a number of bikes, stations that host bikes and users.


> [!idea] 2-part project
> 1. Research using CARMA system and model the system
> 2. Implement the bike sharing system described in 1.1

## Technologies:
- Spring 🍃
- React ⚛
- MySQL 🐬
- CARMA 🚲
- Recommendation System ⛏

### Study sources:
- SaaS Book
- Spring Documentation
- JPA
- Spring Security
- Spring Session
- CARMA documentation

## What information take into account
- bikes (identified by a unique code)
- stations (in several physical locations)
- users (that have accounts)
- set of active trips (associated with a user, a bike, a start station, and a projected end station)
- set of past trips (user, bike, start, finish)
- set of available bikes 
- set of  unavailable bikes

## Use cases
### 1. Simple & smooth bike trip
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	1.1. The user enters their account that already exists
	1.2. They press on the `pick up a bike` tab and specify:
		- the code of the wanted bike (they see physically written on the bike)
		- the projected destination (station B)
	1.3. The user presses on `submit`
		- the wanted bike is available and belongs to station A (where the user is)
		- the user gets a prompt with the number of available free slots in the station B (there are at least 2)
		- the bike is removed from station A and the user session begins
	1.4. The user finishes the ride and presses on `end ride` 
		- they are prompted a form and have to input a unique code from the destination station (that can be either B or any station)
		- the user gets the chance to evaluate the condition of the bike (brakes, direction, etc.) and a final score of the bike condition is computed.
		- the user can leave the bike and their session is ended

### 2. Create a new account
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	2.1. The user presses on `create a new account`
	2.2. They are prompted a form to choose a username and a secure password, also input their e-mail address and phone number
		- their credentials are checked (unique username, strong enough passoword, password match, ...)
	2.3. They are prompted success and can sign in

### 3. Pick up the best bike from a station
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	3.1. The user presses on `pick up a bike` and then, in the form they press on `pick up best bike from station`
	3.2. The user inputs the wanted station and then they get the code of the bike in that station having the best rating.
	(... same steps as use case 1.)

### 4. Trying to pick up a bike that is not available
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	3.1. Try to pick up a bike and input the wanted code
	3.2. The user gets a prompt that states that the wanted bike is unavailable
		- they are instructed to check the correctness of the code
	3.3. The user can get another bike or give up their search

### 5. Wanting to pick up a bike from station A when it becomes available
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	5.1. The user enters the wanted station and presses the button `get notified when a bike becomes available`
		- they can also specify if they want a bike with a rating over a certain value
	5.2. When such a bike becomes available the user gets notified immediately

### 6. The user starts a session that is too long
Actor: User 🚶‍♂️
Steps:
	6.1. The user follows the steps from use case 1
	6.2. The current session has been started for over 2h 
		- the user gets a notfication that they have a certain amount of time left to leave the bike or they get a fine

### Other use cases:
- The user seeks for an answer to a question:
	- They press on get help bubble and with the help of a pop up chat that offers multiple options, find an answer
- The user receives badges and rewards for things like: many trips completed, reporting the bad condition of a bike, ...
- The user chooses to delete the history of bike trips

### CARMA role
- model the bike system resources (environment):
	- stations
	- bikes

### Bike Website Implementation (Spring)
- Logic Layer (BLL) (implemented in controller, use `postman` for testing the functionality):
	- login and persistence of the session of one user (everything about accounts)
	- rides (pickup a bike, interact with the station), leave a bike
	- stations (place, methods corresponding to stations)
- View:
	- basic access of backEnd functionalities (forms, buttons, display, parse JSON)
	- research HTTP in React and Spring

- system recommends in functie de incarcarea statie (neighbourhood, load, traffic load) (last link in the list) - heavy traffic (3 recommendation cu timp estimat) - add to use case (TODO: Choose what to apply for recommendation)
