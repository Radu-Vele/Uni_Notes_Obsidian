# Ch1: Introduction

## Key concepts:
- SaaS - any app hosted on the internet
- Agile Development - code iteration
- Cloud computing
- Plan and Document vs Agile

### Agile
- Extreme programming (fast release)
- Test-Driven Development (test before code)
- Pair programming
- Scrum (use sprints)

### QA:
- unit testing
- integration testing
- system testing
- formal methods (different approach)

## Good practice coding
- reuse
- concisenes
- DRY
- higher order functions
- automation (makefiles, versioning systems)

### SaaS architecture
- run apps on the web
- SaaS programming frameworks
![[Pasted image 20221017100924.png]]
- aligns with Agile
- SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
- Microservices = services specialized for a narrow field of tasks

> [!Important] Summary: 
> Software as a Service (SaaS) is attractive to both customers and providers because the universal client (the Web browser) makes it easier for customers to use the service and the single version of the software at a centralized site makes it easier for the provider to deliver and improve the service. Given the ability and desire to frequently upgrade SaaS, the Agile software development process is popular for SaaS, and so there are many frameworks to support Agile and SaaS


### SaaS Deployment
- Cloud: pay-as-you-go AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
- Docker (run in container - app believes that it owns the whole OS)

> Browser = Universal client

- the use of HTML & CSS

> SOA = service-oriented architecture (small services rather than monolithic design)

### Beautiful vs Legacy Code

> Legacy code = old code that still meets customer needs and can be extended.

Beautiful code is guaranteed to live a long happy life 👵

# Ch 2

## Learning a new language
- find the specific aspects of a language that make it useful to encapsulate within a framework

### Pair programming
- driver 🚘 and observer 🔭

### OOP in Ruby
- skip

## SaaS Application Architecture - our Jam 🎷

### Client-Server Architecture
---

Is basically a design pattern, there are also other design patterns for the web (peer-to-peer = Torrent style)

> URI = universal resource identifier - to access a resource from the web

- The **Client** makes request (e.g. mobile app) to the server and present the information (+ interaction) with the user
- The **server** is specialized to process commands of more clients

We need to deploy a mini server on our computer that lets the developer app (1 client) to interact with it

Client frameworks: {Angular, React, etc.}
Server frameworks: {Spring, Django, Rails, Node, etc.}

> we will use the term “SaaS” (software as a service)
  to mean “client-server systems built to operate using the open standards of the World Wide Web,”

### HTTP Routes Communication
---

`Useful in our app to establish communication between backend and frontend`

> [!Question] To investigate...
> How does **spring** add abstraction over the client-server communication?


Network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP,)

- instead of IP we use DNS (domain name system) (maps hostnames to IP addresses)

- how to refer the host computer which runs our app
```
hostname = localhost
ip addr = 127.0.0.1

default http port = 80
default https port = 443
```

- we also need a **port number**, may depend on your IDE (IntelliJ)

**HTTP Rules:**
- client: init TCP/IP connection with IP + Port Number 
	- check if HTTP server listening to that port exists (success/failure)
- client: send request (operation + resource)
- server: http response sent (success or errors + maybe and HTTP cookie = identify client on future interactions)

Request = string containing more elements
```
Methods:
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
```

Cookies save information about a specific client and can indicate whether a "session" is currently active (e.g. a user is logged in)

### SOA
---

Javascript code added to the web pages could make more requests to the server without the need for reloading the page. Response from **server**: XML or JSON data structure returned

> \[...\] a set of independent services that could be composed to produce larger
  sites—a so-called **Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)**.

- different services can only be accessed through **interfaces** that are external of the service

> Microservice = service that performs a single task (type of task) incorporated within an outside service accessible through an API. Operations related to closely tight set of resources

> A (micro)service is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability though message-based communication

### RESTful APIs
---

> API = convention between callee and caller

> REST = **R**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. 

REST:
	mapping: Requests $\to$ Actions
	- helps us build the service and the API
	- each entity manipulated by the service is represented as a resource given a unique ID

Question an API should answer to
1. What is the primary resource affected by the operation?
2. What is the operation to be done on that resource? What are the possible results? What
are the possible side effects, if any?
3. What other data is necessary to complete the operation, if any, and how is it specified?

Default operations:
- CRUDI

### Additional Explanations on REST

[Video Link]()

- rest api - communication client - server
- restful - uses rest apis
REST API
	- stateless
	- high performance thanks to caching

### Example:
- endpoint: http://icecream.com/api/flavors
	- api portion of the endpoint
	- flavors is the resource

- communication: request +  response

Requests = HTTP methods/operations:
	- create - `POST`
	- read - `GET`
	- update - `PUT`
	- delete - `DELETE`

```
Request:
HEADERS
OPERATION | ENDPONT | PARAMETERS
```

Response = JSON usually:

```
Get flavors in stock

GET 

Replace flavor mint with choco

PUT /api/flavors/1 {"flavor" : "choco"}
``
Add new flavor

CREATE /api/flavors {"flavor" : "rasp"}

```

- **CRUD API**
![[Pasted image 20221115102003.png]]

**JPA**
![[Pasted image 20221115102141.png]]

- REST controller
	- create endpoints

- Model using JPA
	- `@Entity`
	- `@Column`
	- Repo class extending JPA class
	- automatically creates table
- MySQL connection
	- use workbench

Can use postman to test backend
