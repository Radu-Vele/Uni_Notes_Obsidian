## Hello World Setup

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kOGdZmpSDI)

Needed software:

- IntelliJ
- Java 17 (?)
- I think Spring is installed by default

### Dependencies:
- Spring Web

Can add them later

`pom.xml` - contains the dependencies and can add more there

### Java part
- in `src/main/java`
- main automatically created

## Run
- can run the main:
	- [Tomcat](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-tomcat) server starts locally on a specific port

### Creating tests:
- check for respones from server

### Spring controller
- annotate as `@RestController`
- create a request mapping
- can open HTTP clients directly from IntelliJ

> [!Question] Questions
> What exactly is a spring controller?
> How to annotations work?
