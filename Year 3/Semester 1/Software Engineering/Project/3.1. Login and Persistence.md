### Accounts implementation
- check how to create new account -> save in accounts -> authenticate + security

### Frameworks options
- Spring Security (enable mechanisms to control access to pages)
	- I need it to make a secure login
- Spring MVC (Do we need it?)

## Spring MVC

## Spring Security for the Login
- added Service + Repository for student
- used lots of annotations and implemented interfaces defined in Spring security

> [!info] Spring security opens by default a form in html that requests login `\login`
> 	- that is basically securing our endpoints

> [!important] Must use annotation `@CrossOrigin` over out controller to allow it to get requests from FrontEnd

## Form-based authentication

![[Pasted image 20221227160035.png]]

- a cookie is sent back after validation of credentials
- once you login the sessionID is valid for a certain time if you're using the same client
	- the expiration can be erased using a `remember-me`
The sessionIDs are stored in a in-memory-database by default (could modify it to a mySQL table)

### CSRF is disabled - less secure
- with it enable we would not be able to POST requests without a CSRF token
- CSRF useful in real life scenarios

## JWT ðŸŽŸ
> A token that is sent to the front end allowing to do user-specific operations

### What we have so far
- security starter - secure endpoints (redirect to the login page)

### Why JWT
- helps multiple clients access our servers. (multiple applications i.g.)
- don't need to store the current session!!! (or send it in the request's header)
- might need to implement visibility (info on user activity)

### About JWT
- JSON web token
- stateless
- could be added later
- dedicated library in Java JWT

> [!note] The client sends the token for each request
> - header + body + signature

What needs to be done:
- add dependencies
- implementation

### Request filters
- classes that validate requests before allowing usage of the API (JWT filter is one of them)

---

## Approach
- take the project from github and adapt

Next up:
- figure out how the authentication is performed
- figure out how the requests are sent
- extend with a home page with user details.

---

## Session management
- handled by a `sessionStorage` variable in react in `AuthenticationService.js` that contains methods such as:
	- `isUserLoggedIn`
	- `getLoggedInUser`
	- `setUpToken`
- the user is allowed to enter certian pages by using the Protected Routes in React (the authentication is checked)
- when a request is performed from that page, the user is known (`getLoggedInUser`)
- be careful while modifying those, btw

> Then, for example, when we are on the pick up page, we can send a request that contains the user, and the details necessary for the pick up from the front end :)

>[!question] Questions for the next steps?
>- Associate the user with a database with more detailed information about them? idk
