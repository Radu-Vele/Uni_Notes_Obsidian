> [!idea] 2-part project
> 1. Research using CARMA system (optimize stations placement & bikes division)
> 	or just model the system for the sake of using CARMA
> 2. Implement the bike sharing system described in 1.1

### CARMA role
- model the bike system resources (environment):
	- stations
	- bikes

### Bike Website Implementation (Spring)
- Logic Layer (BLL) (implemented in controller, use `postman` for testing the functionality):
	- login and persistence of the session of one user (everything about accounts)
	- rides (pickup a bike, interact with the station), leave a bike
	- stations (place, methods corresponding to stations)
- View:
	- basic access of backEnd functionalities (forms, buttons, display, parse JSON)
	- research HTTP in React and Spring

# Architecture UML

## MVC
- view is in REACT

## Model
Saved in the DB:
- User - in `DATABASE`
	- contains list of Rides (`ArrayList<Ride>`)
	- Attributes: 
		`name`, 
		`e-mail` - unique,
		`password` - safe (encrypted üò≤),
		`id` - for DB
		`ArrayList<int> rideIdList`
		Mechanism for keeping active sessions @Radu search for itüîç
- Station
- Ride - in `DATABASE`
	- Attributes:
		`int startStationId` 
		`int finishStationId` 
		`Date startTime` - check the proper data type for this @Radu
		`Date finishTime` -||-
		`int bikeId`
	- Methods:
		`getDuration(); //returns length of ride`
		...
- Bike 
	- Status (Busy/Free)
