> [!idea] 2-part project
> 1. Research using CARMA system (optimize stations placement & bikes division)
> 	or just model the system for the sake of using CARMA
> 2. Implement the bike sharing system described in 1.1

### CARMA role
- model the bike system resources (environment):
	- stations
	- bikes

### Bike Website Implementation (Spring)
- Logic Layer (BLL) (implemented in controller, use `postman` for testing the functionality):
	- login and persistence of the session of one user (everything about accounts)
	- rides (pickup a bike, interact with the station), leave a bike
	- stations (place, methods corresponding to stations)
- View:
	- basic access of backEnd functionalities (forms, buttons, display, parse JSON)
	- research HTTP in React and Spring
