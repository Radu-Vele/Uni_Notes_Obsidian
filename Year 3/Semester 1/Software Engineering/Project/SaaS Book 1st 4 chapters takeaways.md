# Ch1: Introduction

## Key concepts:
- SaaS - any app hosted on the internet
- Agile Development - code iteration
- Cloud computing
- Plan and Document vs Agile

### Agile
- Extreme programming (fast release)
- Test-Driven Development (test before code)
- Pair programming
- Scrum (use sprints)

### QA:
- unit testing
- integration testing
- system testing
- formal methods (different approach)

## Good practice coding
- reuse
- concisenes
- DRY
- higher order functions
- automation (makefiles, versioning systems)

### SaaS architecture
- run apps on the web
- SaaS programming frameworks

- aligns with Agile
- SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
- Microservices = services specialized for a narrow field of tasks

> [!Important] Summary: 
> Software as a Service (SaaS) is attractive to both customers and providers because the universal client (the Web browser) makes it easier for customers to use the service and the single version of the software at a centralized site makes it easier for the provider to deliver and improve the service. Given the ability and desire to frequently upgrade SaaS, the Agile software development process is popular for SaaS, and so there are many frameworks to support Agile and SaaS


### SaaS Deployment
- Cloud: pay-as-you-go AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
- Docker (run in container - app believes that it owns the whole OS)

> Browser = Universal client

- the use of HTML & CSS
