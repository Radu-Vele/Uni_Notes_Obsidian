# Generally about the systems
- Come from Data Science, AI
- Unsupervised Learning Technique

## Types
- Content based
	- parameters - movie examples
- Collaborative filtering
	- opinions of other users - movie examples
- Hybrid 
	- combination of the two above
- Data mining
- Neighbourhood based

# Our Problem
- recommend a top of three choices of stations for the user to get from point A to point B

> [!important] Port
> Inputs: `coordinatesStart, coordinatesEnd`
> 
> Outputs: 
> 	`station1A -> station1B` 
> 	`station2A -> station2B` 
> 	`station3A -> station3B`

Factors to consider:
- time added by traffic of the cars
- time added by traffic of bikes
- admin-goal: balance the load of the stations

> [!question] Does this problem fit in the category of the recommender systems?

### Route mining / recommendation algorithms:



# The model of our system
- graph - our model

We know:
- distance between stations: $d(S_n \to S_m)$ measured in time (traffic)
- distance between coordinates (consider euclidean distance between points) measured in meters/cm
- number of bikes on the way between  $(S_n, S_m)$

### Proposals
- Using Recommender
	- Search algorithm (Dijkstra)

- Search Algorithm using multiple criteria
	- a series of sorts
