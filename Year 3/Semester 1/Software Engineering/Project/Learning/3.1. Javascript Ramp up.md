### Javascript inside HTML
- Embed snippets of JS into html

```html
<script src = "index.js">
</script>
```

### Variables
```javascript
let variable = init_value

console.log(variable) //print the variable 
```

### Working with buttons

- use onClick function that is executed everytime a button is clicked
- bind onClick to a js function
- can use `document.getElementById.innerText` 

### Functions/Methods

```javascript
function increment() {

}
```

### DOM - Document Object Model
