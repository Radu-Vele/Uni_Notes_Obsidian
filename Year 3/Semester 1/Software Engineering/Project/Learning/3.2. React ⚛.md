## Concepts

### Using JWT and Routing
- [Tutorial](https://www.permify.co/post/jwt-authentication-in-react#:~:text=JWT%2C%20or%20JSON%20Web%20Token,protected%20data%20and%20access%20services.)

## Hooks

> [!important] Rule
> - do not call `useHook` in functions or so, only in toplevel components

### useState
- handle data that changes (when state changes, ui changes)
`const [count, setCount] = useState(initialState)`
- use the setter to change the value

### useEffect
- component: mount -> update -> unmount
- takes a function as argument and react executes it when the DOM changes
- second argument is an array of dependencies, when dependencies change the useEffect is run again
- the return function specifies what happens at unmount of component

### useContext
- share data between modules - cool

### useRef
- keep the same reference between renders
- grab HTML from DOM
- can for example click a btn for a fun.

### useLayoutEffect
- like use state, but no re-render until the function is finished

## Case study - codependent dropdowns station-bike

### Fetch available stations
At **page rendering**: - call `/get-usable-stations`

- [ ] Fetch stations and and the chosen id

### Fetch bikes for a station
