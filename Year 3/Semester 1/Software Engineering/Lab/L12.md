## Message

You have to submit the final project documentation (final report)
for your Software Engineering (SE) project.

### 1) Deadline (for final report submission):
Monday, 2023 January 9, h 20:00 (8:00 pm)

### 2) Each student will submit 1 PDF file containing the final project
- documentation - fără explicații în limbaj natural

(1 pdf file / student; each student will send exactly 1 pdf file !)

- need to emphasize my own part
- evaluate individuală in functie de ce am facut eu

> [!question] Question
> - how exactly are the documentations different within the team?
> - `not so different` - include our own implementation

File name (format):

SE-30432-SurnameFirstname.pdf  (e.g., SE-30432-PopescuIoan.pdf)

The PDF file should be submitted by email to the following address:

eneia.todoran@cs.utcluj.ro

3) Final report (final project documentation) content and recommended
structure:

Title, Author, Abstract, Team (all team members, including the author of
the report)

A. Final project:
- Design: all relevant design models (semi-formal models, e.g., UML
diagrams,
and/or formal models, e.g., PRISM models, Session Types protocols, etc);
projects which use UML as a modeling language should include at least
the following diagrams: use case diagram, class diagram, and deployment
diagram

B. Final project
- implementation (source code)
- Appendix: Mini project (code source only)

C. References

If necessary, the author can extend the above structure with
descriptions of:
- experimental results, test cases, etc.;
- other design, performance, implementation or verification
models and components (not mentioned above)

Remark: The final project should be reasonably self contained. It should
include
only design and implementation models and components developed by the
author of the project.
It is also permitted to include models and/or code developed by the
other members of your team.

Remark: You should not include material (descriptions of design,
implementation or verification aspects)
developed by other authors (which are not members of your development
team).
You should clearly cite all external sources in the References section.
Students who develop the SE project under my supervision
need NOT prepare a Power Point presentation

4) The project will be assessed (during weeks 13 and 14) based on:
- the quality of the executable programs
- the structure and quality of the project documentation
- bibliographic research
