# Lambda Expressions

### Why?
- functions with no name $\Rightarrow$ Lambda Expressions $\lambda$
```haskell
(\ x -> x + x) 3 -- apply l.e. on 3
```

### Where?

- dont "waste names" 

```haskell
squares n = map (\ x->x*x) [n, n+1, n+2]
```

- send functions as arguments
	- describes a way of thinking in functional programming
```
-- send the functions to describe the wanted order of list elements 
-- in function that checks if a list is ordered
```

- give formal meaning to curried functions (see the effect of curried function i.e. arguments passed one at a time)

# List comprehension

>[!note] Generators
> Helps us enumerate list elements. Looks like the math definition of sets somehow.

### Ranges
- progression style
```haskell
[1..6] -- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

[6..1] -- []

[2, 4..10] -- keep difference between elements
```

- can describe infinite lists (lazy evaluation pays off)

### Generate comprehensions
- use guards
- looks like maths

```haskell
[x | x <-[1..10], odd x]
--[1,3,5,7,9]
[(b,g) | b <- [] g <-[]] -- cartesian product
```

- more possible options
- the inner loop can be reversed (example in slides pg.16)
- interesing example: inner product, Cauchy product 
- quickSort: two ways

### Permutations
- eliminate all occurences of a value
- generating permutations:
	- algorithm for generating all permutations

```
Permutations: [1, 2, 3] [1, 3, 2] [3, 2, 1]

General method:

- generate permutations for 1-element list: [[1]]

For 2-elements lists:
- take the first element and hold it
	- then generate all permutations of the rest (the second element)
	- then inject the holded elements in front of "all" permutations
- take the second element:
	- -||-

For 3-element list
- hold each member at a time and follow the same approach


? can we have repeated elements

Maybe different approach can be used by dropping and taking
```

- all these are general structures (the functions work for many type of structures)

# Higher order functions

## Map 
- apply operation of each element of the list

## Filter
- select elements based on criteria

## Foldr
- take as example addition of elements in a list, product, etc...
- create a pattern function that behaves this way

```haskell
foldr:: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr (+) 0 -- sum
--operation initial value
foldr (*) 1 --product
```

- will come back to this

# Combinators

For example we want to take arguments from right:

### C combinator

> [!note] Combinator 
> - function with no `free` variables

```haskell
combC f x u = f y x --a.k.a flip
combC (-) 1 9 --combC swaps arguments of that function
```

### K combinator


### Point-free style

- grades conversion example
- point-free style i.e. "hide" arguments 
- avoid it for now, but useful in later applications
