# Lecture 2: Operators

## Identifiers
- letter start, + digits _ +  '
- can define constant (but **immutable functions only**)
- infix operators (function written between two arguments, like in maths)
- can define operators (like operator oveloading I guess)
- Using the `infix` keyword + defining the:
	- **precedence** 
	- **associativity** (`infixl` left/`infixr` right)
```haskell
infixl 6 |+| --6 is highest priority
```

Can use infix as prefix by putting it between brackets

## Type & Checking the Type
- assured operations and compile-time checking

A. **Strongly typed languages** = type <-> entity 
B. Weakly typed

## Type inference is featured in Haskell
Type checking:
	- static (compile time)
	- dynamic (runtime)

- draws conclusions based on the statements

## Primitive Types
- Int, Integer $\rightarrow$ + - `div` `mod` , relational operators
	- Integer allows manipulating digits as elements of lists (for big integers)
	- Int is faster - the CPU is adapted to process it in O(1)

- Float, Double $\rightarrow$ + - * /, relational
	- Can use scientific notation

- Bool


### Chars and Strings
- char '.'
- string "."
Concatenation with operator ++


### Lists
- defined as `[1, 2, 3]` 
- any type (ALL THE SAME) , any length

```haskell
head [1, 2, 3] -- 1st element
-- 1
tail [1, 2, 3]
-- [2, 3]
null [1, 2, 3]
-- false
1:[2, 3] --cons
-- [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2] ++ [3, 4] --concat
--
length [1, 3, 4]
--3
elem 2 [1, 2, 3] --check if contains 2
-- True
[1, 2, 3] !! 1
-- 2
```

## Tuples
>[!note] Tuple
>Sequence of components (finite). 

### Why tuples?
- functions that return complex nrs, vectors, etc.

```haskell
type Person = (String, Int, Char, String)

a1 :: Person --constructor
a1 = ("Brad", 20, 'M', "Los Angeles")
```
- extracting info from a tuple: - *deconstructing* the tuple

```haskell
(name, age, gender, town) = a1; --find info for each member of the tuple
```

## Union/sum/enumerate
- use `data` keyword
- offer some constructors to be used
- `deriving(Show)` means that the system will let us display the value 
- can "overwrite" the display mode

## Records
- like a table record (type and name for a field)

```haskell
data Prs = Prs
	{ name :: String,
	, age :: Int,
	, sex :: Char
	}

a1 = Prs { name = "Brad", age = 59, sex = 'M'}

```

## Polymorphic Types

- polymorphism is used to allow more types
- polymorphic functions

```haskell
head:: [a] -> a -- a can get to be several types
```

- well-typed expressions $\Leftarrow$ Inference can be done 

$$\frac{f::A\to B \space e::A}{f \space e::B}$$
- example on factorial function

### Overloading functions
- polymorphic function and its type has one or more constraints
- types are grouped in **type classes** to add a new type to a class you must provide the implementation for that class behavior

|Class|Examples|Operation|
|-|-|-|
|Eq|Int, Char, Lists|== and \\=|
|Ord|Belonging to Eq and additional operations|< <= >= min, max|
|Show||can be displayed with `show`|
|Num||+-* negate abs signum|
|Integral|"superclass of Int and Integers"||
|Fractional|||

### Polymorphic equality
- equality type
>[!important] Understanding the type system is the key to correct functions

Examples
- the inferred type is choosing the most general type possible
- spoiler: all functions are functions of one parameter
- other ways for specifing types (alias, enumerations)
- constructors with arguments (**important**)
- matrix multiplication example

> [!important] Type system 
> offers the oportunity to define protection against doing wrong operations


```haskell
-- Create a Matrix Type, make it belong to a class and implement the necessary operations for that class

data Matrix2x2 = Mat2 ( (Integer, Integer),
						(Integer, Integer)) 												
-- A 2-component tuple containing 2 component tuples :)
	deriving(Show)

-- we want it to behave like a Num ("superclass" of all numbers)

instance Num Matrix2x2 where
	Mat2(a1, a2) * Mat2 (b1, b2) =
		let
			() =  -- extract components of each line by deconstructing
			()
			()
			()
		in
			-- Matrix multiplication implementation

-- compute the power of a matrix

infixr 8 |^|

Mat2(a1, a2) |^| n = ... --implementation

```
