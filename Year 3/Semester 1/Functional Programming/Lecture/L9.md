# Iterate & Corecursion

## Example for Data streams

- Problem: CNP - generate all CNP s having 12 identical digits and one position where digits are different.

```haskell
```

### Primes stream
- generate prime numbers


# `Iterate` in Haskell

```haskell
iterate f x = x : iterate f (f x)
```

- contraction function (Banach) - the demonstration is similar to Haskell iterate
- the process goes to a fixed point

Examples:
- computer sqrt a iteratively -> define a function that determines the iteration to stop
- Cauchy sequences

> [!important] The compoents
> - next step
> - very close

### PageRank algorithm - was used by google as the first algorithm to sort results
- 50-100 iterations yield a pretty good result
- visit again
- the nr 10 in football


## Corecursion
- use iteration
