# More on Lambda Calculus

## Data structures
### Pairs
- once we have pairs we can create lists => trees => so on
```
PAIR := \xyf.fxy -- pair constructor
FST := \p.pT
SND := \p.pF
NIL := \x.T
```

- make sure to know how to derive

## Recursion
- modelling recursion when functions have no names

#### Additional function: Shift and Increment
- map a pair of 2 elements into another pair (second, succ second)

#### Predecessor
$$\text{PRED} := \lambda n.\text{FST}(n \phi (\text{PAIR} (0 0)))$$
#### Self-regenerating function

> [!info] Tip
> There is an interpreter online for lambda calculus to make sure we have the right definitions

$$Y:=$$

```
YR = R(YR) 
	-- trigger a series of expression that result in a call of R and the same expression
```
- this is the heart of lambda expression recursion

How to stop?
- R has a condition that returns something

- example: factorial
```
use a FACTO and the Y function defined before with the property YR = R(YR)
```


## De Bruijn Index
Drop the names of variables
- used for helping us read demonstrations in Mikrokosmos ðŸ˜º
> [!info] Def
> The index of a variable is replaced by how many lambdas to call to move that variable out of the scope. ðŸ§ ++

- the scope of the function gives an indication on how to interpret the de Bruijn Index notation

```
:)

\x.(\y.(\z. z z) y (\z. z y)) <=> \\((\(1 1) 1) \(1 2))
```

- practice with [Mikrokosmos](https://mroman42.github.io/mikrokosmos/)
```
\ \ 2 \1 = \ \ 1

Switch to x, y notation
(\x.(\y. x)) (\ts. ts) 
\y. (\ts.ts)

Back to de Bruijn
\ \ 1
```


## Typed Lambda Calculus

Why do we need?
- we may have multiple definitions for operations but they work only in certain situations (logical, arithmetic, bla bla)
- therefore we need typed Lambda Calculus

## Semantics
- predicates represented using trees
- semantics can be expressed using $\lambda$

## Combinatory Logic

Combinators used:
- I ->`I M = M`
- K  -> `K M N = M`
- S -> `S L M N = L N (M N)`

We only need S and K to build any other combinator

> [!remark] ðŸ¤¯
> Any $\lambda$ can be built using S and K
