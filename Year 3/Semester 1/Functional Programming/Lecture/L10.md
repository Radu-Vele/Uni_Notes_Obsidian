# Lambda Calculus
- worth taking a minute to think ðŸ§ 

Base of all functional programming languages
- a basic programming language

Considerations
- Turing machine (Alan Turing) - general model for programming
- von neumann architecture (memory stores data + instructions + PU + PC)
- lambda calculus - **Alonzo Church** â›ª
- Haskell Curry- formalism over lambda calculus (`S` and `K`)

#### Lambda calculus
- assemble programs using just a few building blocks (minimalist)
- universal -> works everywhere
- Turing-complete language = as powerful as turing machine (can express)
- no states
- `unary` functions - only one parameter

## Lambda expressions

$$ E = x | (\lambda x.E) |(E_1 E_2)$$
Concepts:
- variable
	- free
	- bound
- functional abstraction
- function application

### Syntax simplifications


## Conversions

> [!important] Rules
> - $\alpha$ Conversion
> - $\beta$ Conversion
> - $\eta$ Conversion

### Reduction
- apply $\beta$ conversions on subexpressions of the source lambda expression

Normal form -> cannot apply reductions from further on
	- doesn't depend on how we perform the reductions (if $\exists$ normal form)

> [!Note] Strategy 1: `call by name`
> - do not evaluate expressions unless needed
> - looks like the lazy evaluation

> [!note] Strategy 2: `call by value`
> - may lead to never ending substitutions

> [!tip] Framework when doing exercises:
> - outcome: perform simplifications and manipulate $\lambda$
> - can't commit to only one strategy
> - `call-by-name` is the safe choice

- Redex

## Arithmetic

### Represent numbers
- Church encoding
```
0 := \sz.z
1 := \sz.s(z)
How many times we apply s on z
```
- successor function
> [!tip] In the `Exam`
> We should be able to apply conversions and simplify

```
```

- pluÈ™
```
PLUS := \mn.m SUCC n - no need to memorize it tho
```

> [!important] Building blocks for `PLUS`
> - church representation
> - succ

- mult
```
MULT = \mn.m (PLUS n) 0
```

## Logical operations
- logical values are defined as lambda
$$T = \lambda xy.x$$
$$F=\lambda xy.y$$
- AND
```
and = \
```
- OR
- NOT
- COND (`if-then-else`)

### Examples
- test if a number is zero
```
isZ = \x.xF!F
```
