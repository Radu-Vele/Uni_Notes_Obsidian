# Lazy Evaluation and its power

## Lazy evaluation 🐌

### Example of a lazy operation
- `:sprint x` - print x but do not evaluate it (see intermediary memory values)
```haskell
x = _ -- unevaluated a.k.a. thunk

-- force evaluation of x
x
-- 3
sprint x
-- x = 3
```

Somehow, here we see a side-effect

> use `seq` to force evaluation `seq y ()` -- () is a unity type - cardinality = 1

Some thunks can be evaluated if other thunks that are evaluated depend on them

### Example: Map as a lazy function 

> [!Important] WHNF
> Weak head normal form
> - expressions are evaluated up to a cons / lambda expression
> 
> Appears in case of:
> - constructors
> - lambda abstractions
> - built-in function with too few arguments

- For example, calling a length on a list doesn't necessarily imply evaluating its elements

## Infinite lists
```haskell
twos = [2, 2..] --won't blow up in haskell, but we can't generate the whole list
```

### Usage examples:
- sieve
- min of list using insertion sort min and ins)
	- we won't have to actually compare all values in the insertion sort as we will get the head of the list earlier
	- the operations meanings are extracted
	- `O(n)`

> [!warning] Debugging lazy structure
> Difficult as we need to know what part was evaluated already or not

# Circular Structures

### Fibonnaci sequences 
- define the f_n as sum of previous 2 sequences

```haskell

fibonnaciGen n = take n f0 where
	f0 = 0:f1
	f1 = 1:f2
	f2 = zipWith (+) f0 f1
```

Works like a "factory" of fibonnaci numbers
- the program is a network of streams, synchronization is achieved by lazy evaluation

### Hamming numbers 
Rule for sequence of hamming numbers:
- in slides

### Well 👼 and Bad 😈 Founded Definitions
- generate circular structures, but we need to be able to evaluate elements that we know the value of.

# Memoization via Circular Structures
- cache values and reuse
- achieved using lazy evaluation without the programmer to worry 😌
