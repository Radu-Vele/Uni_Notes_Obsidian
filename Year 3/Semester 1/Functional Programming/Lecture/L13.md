# I/O

Sometimes the functor does not have access to data

## I/O Monad

```haskell
-- Interactive program in Haskell = pure functions
type IO a = World -> (a, World) -- ()
```

### Actions
- `getChar :: IO Char` - read and return the character
- `putChar`

### `do` Notation
- is equivalent to a sequence of IO actions
- syntax sugaring for an expressions that allows only pure functions

### IO as functor

### IO as applicative

### Examples:
- sequenceA allows reading one by one from a string (list) and getting  a list of results

- check div implementation
	- do notation is a syntax sugaring for multiple `>>=` 


## Eval Monad
- for parallel programming in Haskell

> Idea: We need more speed (use more cores)

`runEval` - perform computation
`rpar` - can parallelize
`rseq` - evaluate and wait for result

- use do notation to express its working more clearly
- see example in the slides

- next up: analyze properties functional programs
