# Lecture 1
# Functional Programming 101

**Declarative programming** paradigm encompasses functional.

Functional composition used for complex programs

## Why functional?
- the functional paradigm promotes functions as basic units (without actually specifying the way the function is built)

>[!NOTE] Program = Function

### Principles of Functional Programming ðŸ§ :
1. Functions can be parameters of other functions, returned from functions, stored, etc. (**first class citizens**)
2. **No side effects** of functions (only the result is produced) (spoiler: later we will see a minimal occurance of side effects)
3. **Expressions** used instead of statements (`check out later`)
4. Only **combinations of functions**, no sequential instructions (As in C)
5. **Immutability** for variables
6. The state of the program does not exist
7. Only recursion and not loops

>[!Remark] This will help us later
>Even if we don't directly write functional code (purely), our code will benefit

>[!IMPORTANT] Remarks
>Each entity is associated a type (type inference happens) => compile-time errors
>We rely on expressions

We will study:
	- **Haskell** (pure functional)
	- Elm (I think)
Other FP languages:
	- LISP
	- ML

## Examples
- computing the reciprocal (1/)
	- / is a function
- sorting lists (is not QuickSort)
```haskell
q [] = []
q (x:xs) = q [ s | s <- xs, s <=x] ++ --list comprehension
			[x] ++
			q (filter (>x) xs) --filter returns the
```
- generating infinite list of primes

## Evaluation
- REPL ()
- Batch (use files)

## Defining functions in Haskell

```haskell
--batch

area :: Double -> Double
area r = 3.14 * r * r

-- REPL
$ ghcl
Prelude> sq x = x*x
```

- can find the inferred type using `:type <function_name>` , the type inferred is the most general one 

### Types
- built-in types existing (int, ...)
- can define new types

```haskell
data New_bool = New_true | New_false -- the new type is based on two constructors, the New_bool can be displayed on a screen
	deriving (Show)
```

- new_not example

### Function call
```haskell
--fun_name arg1 arg2 arg3
f x (x*z) (g t)
```

- Rules:
	- use parantheses to be sure of priority of operations

### Expressions
- if-then-else
```haskell
if E then ET else E -- MUST have an else because if is an EXPRESSION
```

- case

### Pattern matching mechanism
- patterns are matched and their order matters
- multiple ways of creating patterns (equations, expressions)

---

## Recursion

>[!info] This is the way loops are implemented in FP

### Various examples
- linear recursion
- ackermann 

### Tail recursion
Is the style of writing recursive functions:
- returns a value directly computed 
Or
- returns a value retuned by a called function
... To be continued
