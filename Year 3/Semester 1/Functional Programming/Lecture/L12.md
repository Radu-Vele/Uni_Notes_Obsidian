# Functors, Applicatives, Monads 

### Concepts visited:

1. Classes
- typeclasses - classes that share a common behavior

2. Functor 
- mappers generalization
- decompose, apply, recompose

3. Applicatives
- function application generalization
> map functions with arbitrary nr of arguments

4. Monads
- stateful programs
> programs with effects (I/O)


### Introducing a new type
- `class` - typeclasses, similarity with Java Interfaces
- e.g.:
	- `Eq` with operators `(==)` `(\=)` 
```haskell
class Eq a where
	(==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
	(x /= y) = not (x == y)
```

- instances creation:
	- use `instance` to provide our own implementation
	- use `data ... deriving(<TypeClass>)` to let ghc infer implementation

## Functors

> [!info] Functor
> - type class that maps functions on structures
> - use `fmap` function to extract the value wrapped, apply function and rewrap the result
> - `fmap` is also written infix `function <$> wrapped_operand`

```haskell
fmap (+1) (Just 42) -- result: Just 43
```

- for a list fmap is just a  map

```haskell
-- example: making function into a Functor using composition
cool - check it out
```

- why to do that:
	- Write generic code
	- functions using fmap can work on types later introduced

> [!important] Functor maps
> - `fmap id = id`
> - `fmap (g . h) = fmapp g . fmap h`
> - there is at most one `fmap` for a parametrized type

> How to remain pure and deal with effects?
> - the category theory `maths`

## Applicatives

> How to apply functions with multiple parameters to multiple structures?
> - define multiple fmaps
> - use applicatives
> guess which one we choose

> [!info] Applicatives
> - rely on currying functions
> - use:
> 	- `pure` - convert something pure to a wrapped value 
> 	- `<*>`  - have a wrapped function, a wrapped structure and reture a wrapped structure
> 	- mechanism: always return wrapped functions that may happen to accept no more arguments (result)

Making list an applicative
```haskell
instance Applicative [] where
	pure x = [x]
```

- examples:
	- check out slides

Wrap up:
1. Maybe supports exceptionall programming
2. Lists support non-deterministic programming (apply multiple dunctions to all combinations of parameters)

> [!important] Laws of Applicative
> - id behaves as identity
> - can swap 
> - can swap - `check it out later`
> Eventually all well-typed expression can be written using:
> `pure g <*> x1 <*> ... <*> xn`

## Monads

- build on top of applicatives

> [!info] Monads
> - typeclasses that are subclasses of applicative
> - functions `return` (like pure) and `>>=` (bind - tells me that I have a boxed entity and a function that returns a boxed entity)

- bind can be seen as a way of inputting 

Maybe monad
- handle exceptions nicely

Example: assume n >= 1 - Collatz conjecture

```
c n = if (n is even) then return n/2 
	else (3 * n  + 1)
```
