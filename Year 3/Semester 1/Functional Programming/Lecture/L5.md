# Practice-ish to use the concepts

## Cross Entropy computation

Pre-discussed concepts:
- ML classifiers
	Create and train a model based on a data set as input. Models can bring conclusions regarding inputs.
	Models output a probability distribution
- Random variables
	e.g. let a random var with 3 options: dog, cat, tiger
	Probability distribution (sum of all probabilities is 1)

> Cross entropy - computes the difference between a true probability and a predicted probability. Used to asses how a model behaves

Goal: write as idiomatic as possible ðŸ˜Ž

```haskell
-- 1st solution if-else

-- Remark: avoid if-else after we gain experience


--2ns solution uses guards

--3rd solution uses pattern match

--4th solution uses tail recurion

--5th solution uses zip, map, lambda
crossEnt ts ps = 
	sum
		(map (\ (t,p) -> (-1) * t * (logBase 2 p)) (zip ts ps))

--6th solution uses zipWith

--7th sol uses list comprehenion
```

## Implement sets as lists

- Implement set & Write functions that manipulate them

Use lists as storage resource

```haskell
type Set a = [a] --a type alias

-- add elements
-- avoid duplicating elements

-- listToSet

-- card

-- inSet
	-- improve with binary search

-- delElem

-- union

-- intersection

-- subset

-- set equality

-- power set

-- cartesian product
```

Example:
- aranjamente

```haskell
ors s = foldr (++) [] (map perm (powerset s))

-- [1, 2, 3]
-- powerset: [], [3], [2], [3, 2], ...
-- perm [3] = [3], perm[3, 2] = [[3, 2], [2, 3]]
-- foldr (++) [] list => append
-- [[], [3], [2], [3, 2], [2, 3], ...]
```

- generate all subsets

## Triangulation Problem
- triangulate a convex polygon by  non-intersecting diagonals

1. A recursion problem
	$$T_8 = 2*(T_7 + T_6*T_3 + T_5 * T_4 + ...)$$
	- aspects to consider when implementing in Haskell:
		- save computed data in a list and carry them with you (memoization

```haskell
t2 n = t2a 1 [1] where
	t2a k cs
	| k == n - 1 = head cs
	| otherwise = t2a ....
```

- nice extensions from the triangulation problem: multiplication of matrices
	- decision: choose the order of multiplications (influences the number of total operations)

## Fibonnacci

```haskell
--classic
fib n | n == 0 = 0
	  | n == 1 = 1
	  | otherwise ...

--tail recursion
fib n = fib2 n 1 0 where
	fib2 n i j | n==0 = j
			   | otherwise = fib2 (n - 1) (i  + j) i

```

### Other implementation
- Matrix based computation (Knuth)

Our approach (Haskell):
- go logarithmic in the multiplication ðŸ˜² cool. 
- combine log + tail recursion
- extract

Interesting concept
- infinite lists in haskell
