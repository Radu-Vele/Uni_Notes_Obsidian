# Higher Order Functions ++

> Functions are regarded as data

### Examples:
- insertion sort using higher order functions
- functions can be members of data structures
	This way we could apply a sequence of functions at a time

### Function Equality
- can be defined according to multiple definitions:
	1. they have the same body
	2. they return the same value for the same set of inputs

## Functional composition
`(.)`

- `f.g ` means apply g first and then apply f to the result.
- the result of the composition is a nameless function

ðŸš©example to exercise


## Function application
- create a function application operator `$`

## Reminder

### `map` Function
- its implementation is based on list comprehension
- more general than the map we saw on Lists
### `filter` Function
- also defined using list comprehension

> These functions separate iteration and item processing

### `foldr`  
- rely on it for applying different operations
- can define custom operations and redefine other previously visited operations

> [!info] Trick:
>  replace every cons with the operation and empty list by specified value and `right associativity` = rightmost operation is performed first

```haskell
mynewappend xs = foldr (:) xs
-- Input ["Amen", "Thats", "It"]

> foldr (:) ["amen"] ["that's", "it"]
-- "that's" : "it" : [] => "that's": ["it", "amen"]
-- => "that's":"it":"amen"

mynewflatten = foldr (++) []
-- previous exaple: [that'sitamen]
```

### `foldl`
- passepartout image may prove useful for evaluating
- make the tree like previously, and then reflect the tree
- left associativity
```
foldr (++) r
vs
foldl (++) r
```

- foldl is associated with tail recursion (we can say it's better as it can be optimized)

Before making the first operation in foldl the whole expression needs to be generated

> [!warning] Foldl works different in elm
> - reverse the list and perform foldr style operation
> - elm has identicaly sigantures for `foldl` and `foldr`, while haskell has different ones

### Exercises

```haskell
-- ex 1
-- ((((0 op 1) op 0) op 1) op 1)
-- ex 2
-- foldr (\l) 0 [1, 1, 0, 1]
-- same as before but in disguise
```

### `foldl'`
- strict version of foldl that forces the inner-most evaluation to be performed first

> [!note] Conclusion
> we should use foldr and foldl' in reality

### `foldr1`
- fimilar to foldr that works on empty lists as well


### `scanl`
- like foldl but we can see the intermmediate acummulator values

> [!important] Fold power
> any function can be written using an element of the `fold` family in the proper way

### `unfold`
- starts from a result and creates a structure according to the operation

Example: get a number in binary

## Other functions

### `takeWhile`
- take elements as long as they satisfy a prediate

### `span`
- split the list at first element not satifying an argument  => tuple

### `splitAt`
- takes the given number of elements
