# First Lab

## Installing the software
- ELM (with node.js as prerequisite)
- Chocolatey

## Lab Text Takeaways

### Elm 101
- Syntax
- Definitions
- Building blocks (if expressions, recursion)

>[!important]
>Expression-oriented
**Type inference**
>No exceptions
>Python-like indentation

**Function signatures**
```elm
t1 -> t2 -> t3 --last one is returned
```

**IF**
- once again, if must have an else

**Recursion**
	- New concept -> **Tail recursion** (either return a direct result or something returned by the recursive call, the last thing is to return itself)
	- challenge: avoid stack overflow

> [!important] Tail call optimization
> Is the solution to aviod stack overflow.
> For ex  for factorial function (fact):
> Use 2 parameters (one param and one accumulator)
> - only one stack frame will be used and the intermmediate result is kept in the accumulator 
>

**Fibonnaci** example
	- fib 30 = 3 seconds fib 45 = 12 seconds fib 50 = more than 1min
	- fibTail works really fast (instantaneously ðŸ¤¯)

**REPL**
	- can write on multiple lines

## Problems
1. Implement in Elm the Euclid-style greatest common divisor function, gcd a b, in a tail recursive manner. Be sure to test your implementation for all of these values! Did you manage to implement the function without getting any compile errors?

Reminder: Greatest common divisor implies

```elm
-- gcd 70 12 (find greatest common divisor)
-- 70 % 12 = 10 (rest)
-- 12 % 10 = 2 
-- 10 % 2 = 0 => return 2 (the result because it is the first value that has the result a % result = 0)  

gcd a b = if b == 0 then a else gcd b (a % b) -- Remark, % not found by elm but it has other words for that, which is modBy

gcd a b = if b == 0 then a else gcd b (modBy b a)
```

2. Write an Elm function called ack, which computes the values of the Ackermann function

```elm
-- three branches for the ackermann

ack n m = if n == 0 then (m + 1) else if m == 0 then ack (n-1) 1 else ack (n - 1)  (ack n (m - 1))
```

3. Write an Elm function called sudan, which computes the values of the function of Gabriel Sudan (denoted by S), defined as follows:

```elm
sudan n x y = if n == 0 then x + y else
if n > 0 && y == 0 then x
else sudan (n-1) (sudan n x (y - 1)) (y + (sudan n x (y - 1)))
```
