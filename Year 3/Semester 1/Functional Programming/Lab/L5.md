# Reading material Takeaways

## Pipelines `|> <|` 

```elm
x |> f = f x
f <| x = f x
```

- Use the operator for better readability, longer sequences of operations, avoiding parantheses (`<|`)

```elm
sumOfOddLastDigits: List Int -> Int
sumOfOddLastDigits l =
	l
	 |> filter (\x -> modBy 2 x == 1)
	 |> map (modBy 10)
	 |> foldl (+) 0
```

## Function Composition `>>  <<`
- compose left $\to$ right or reverse
- used for concision

---

## Debugging
- `Debug.log` - helps us print statements during function execution
- `Debug.toString` - what does it do?

---

## Advanced records

### Records accessors
- access record member with `.field_name`
- can apply it to any record containing a field with that name (can be used as a function or like java methods)

### Record updates
- multiple ways
1. Create new instance
2. Create in place
3. Destructure

---

## More on `Maybe` and `Result`

Use map including Maybe and Result: `Maybe.map`

Extract values without pattern match: `Maybe.withDefault`
- have a default value returned when the other param is not valid: `Maybe.andThen`

Add behavior at error: `Maybe.mapError`

Can add error handling in the pipelines

---

## Package Management
- can add packages

---

## Test with `elm-test`

- use the tests folder to define tests
- structure: Test function : Expectation : Test
- try it out

### Organize tests with `describe`
- nest tests
- use `skip` to only run wanted tests

# ToDo
- Install test
- Setup VScode with ELM
- Run tests (to be sure they work in the assignment)
