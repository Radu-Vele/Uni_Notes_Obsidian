# Laboratory 2: Basic Type Definitions

# Reading Material Takeaways

## Modules
- written in text files (.elm)
```elm
module CapitalCase exposing (..)
-- at least one deifinition
```
- load it in REPL
- module is reloaded when used in repl (even after import)


## Tuples ðŸŒ· and Records
- tuple declaration

> [!NOTE] Tuple
> - more elements, different types allowed
> - finite (at most 3 items in elm)
> - I think deconstructing works only in Haskell

> [!Note] Record
> - like a C struct

> [!question] What is the meaning of a in?
> \<function> : { a | firstName : String, lastName : String } -> String (pag 4)
> - where is the name of the record specified? - see in the next section

## New custom data types
### a. Aliases
- keyword `type alias` 
- can instance simply by calling the record or using the Elm constructor
```elm
--call by constructor
User "Haskell" "Curry"
```

ðŸŒŸGood practice: use type aliases for records and stuff.

### b. Type definitions
- actual new types
- can go for union / enumerated types or 
- can have the same word for type and constructor

```elm
type type_name = constructor Int Int
```

- can also add data for each member of the union

- Sum type: **cardinality** is computed by addition 
- Product type: types with multiple fields, cardinality is computed as product of cardinalities of each field

ðŸš©**Computing cardinality**:
```
|Float| = F
|Shape| = |Circle| + |Rectangle| + |Triangle|
		= F + F * F + F * F * F

(Shape, Float) = (F + F * F + F * F * F) * F
```

## Local Declarations
- don't repeate code by using `let..in` expression

> [!tip] Advantages
> - avoid shadowing errors
> - hide helper functions (keep them local)

## Pattern matching & destructuring
The constructor works both ways (**create** an instance, **retrieve** fields from an instance)

- can use destructuring to access data pieces in a type
- can ignore some of the fields by using `_ _` don't care pattern

Pattern matching:
- can use case expression (can use it instead of nested ifs)
- wildcard or "catch-all" pattern: `_`

```elm
area : Shape -> Float
area shape =
	case shape of
		Circle radius -> pi * radius * radius
		Rectangle width height -> width * height
		Triangle a b c -> heron a b c
```

- order matters, first match is taken, must cover all cases (exhaustivity)

## Questions

`Question 2.7.2:` Cardinality of Int: $2^{31} + (2^{31}-1)$ 

```elm
type Int = [-2**31..0] | [0..2**31] --ish
```

`Question 2.7.3:` Self Research
