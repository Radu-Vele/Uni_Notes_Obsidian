# Lazy evaluation & Infinite DS

## Exceptions

### Bottom values:
- `undefined` equivalent to elm's `_` `?`
- shouldn't really use exception signaling

## Lazy Evaluation 🦥

Expressions are evaluated only when required

> [!info] Cool 😎
> In `if` expressions only one branch gets evaluated so if a value that would cause a crash is on the other branch the program runs fine.

## Infinite ranges
- like ranges in python
```haskell
[1, 3, ..] -- omit the upper limit
```

## `sprint` cmommand
- show the evaluated part of a data structure

## Control laziness

- execution time with `:set + s`

### NF and WHNF
- normal form a.k.a. fully evaluated
- whnf - it can be further applied on something

### `seq`
- take advantage of laziness and evaluate only the first argument and return the second one

### Fold operations
- different implementations in haskell (see [lecture content](obsidian://open?vault=University%20Notes&file=Year%203%2FSemester%201%2FFunctional%20Programming%2FLecture%2FL7))
- can use strict foldl

> [!question] Question
> Do we mention the actual way of computing foldl and foldr? 🤓

## Circular lists and Data Streams
- use the structure itself to expand it
