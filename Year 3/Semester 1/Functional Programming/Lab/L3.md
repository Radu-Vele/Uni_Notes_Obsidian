# Theory Takeaways

## Type Variables
- can be used in function definitions
- not to be confused with normal variables

### Type constraints
- type variables would be too general without them
- like interfaces

1. appendable
2. number
3. comparable

### Equality
- autoimplemented in elm

a. Reference equality
b. Structural equality

- can take advantage of immutability to use reference equality

> [!note] Can't modify `==` function

### Error handling

- the concept of null reference is elimintate thanks to the `maybe` type

***Maybe type***

***Result type***
- solves a limitation of Maybe
- offers info about why the function failed

***Enum Types***
Can define string errors or define lots of types for each error

# Lists
- singly-linked lists

`Cons` and `Nil`

- need to work tail-recursive

### Implemented functions:
- appendTail


# ToDo
- Exercise 3.4.1
- Ex 3.5.4
