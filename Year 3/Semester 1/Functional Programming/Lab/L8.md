# Haskell 1

## Prerequisites
- download

## Covered Concepts

### Type definitions and aliases

Alias: `type Kelvin = Float`
Definition: `data Color = R | G | B`

### Local declarations
- use `where`

### Pattern matching
- use case like in elm - can have no match (no warning)
- use guards
```haskell
-- function definition
| fibPat 0 = 0
| fibPat 1 = 1
| fibPat n = fibPat (n - 1) + fibPat (n - 2)
```
- define functions partially
- `@` pattern - access bits of the matched pattern

### List comprehensions

```
[elements in list | generator | filters]
```

### Syntax sugaring
- infix operators
- no pipes but <| is `$` and left composition << is `.` 

## Summary: Differences from Elm
In Haskel...
- Cons is `:` 
- data instead of type for type definitions
- declare variables after we use them using `where`
- pattern matching using guards `|`
- can forget to add patterns in case
- list comprehension
- infix operators definitions
- pipe left is `$` composition left is `.` - can define the others as infix functions
- has something like big integer (Arbitrary decision integer)

### Exercises
- check out guards

Average
```haskell
average l = 
	let
		s = sum l
		len = length l 
    in  
		fromInteegral s / fromIntegral l
```

Add Bigs
```haskell
...
```
