## Differences from Elm
In Haskel...
- Cons is `:` 
- data instead of type for type definitions
- declare variables after we use them using `where`
- pattern matching using guards `|`
- can forget to add patterns in case
- list comprehension
- infix operators definitions
- pipe left is `$` composition left is `.` - can define the others as infix functions
- has something like big integer (Arbitrary decision integer)

### Exercises
- check out guards

Average
```haskell
average l = 
	let
		s = sum l
		len = length l 
    in  
		fromInteegral s / fromIntegral l
```

Add Bigs
```haskell
```
