# Reading Material Takeaways 📚

## Architecture
Instead of MVC use `Model-View-Update` or `Elm Architecture` for web apps.
- as we don't have mutability

### The `Model`
- data definition (record)
- Internal state of the application

### The `View`
- function 
```elm
view: Model -> Html Msg --return view displayed to user based on model
```

### The `Update`
- function
- when an event from HTML is generated
```elm
update: Msg -> Model -> Model --return a model based on current state and message (action)
```

> [!note] Msg type
> All possible actions that can affect the app

## Examples of Elm Web apps

### How to run 🏃‍♂️:
use `elm reactor` - takes the elm code and shares it live ▶

### Creating HTML views
- see `Recipe.elm` file

### Counter program
- see `Counter.elm`

## Web apps behind the scenes

- the web frameworks interact directly with the DOM (Document object models)

To overcome the slow proces of rendering pages from scratch (as Elm is immutable) `VDOM` is used
	- after VDOM is redered $\to$ Elm compares differences to the previous VDOM and performs **incremental updates**.

## Handling immutability
- elm apps are fully deterministic 
- elm specific concept: `tasks`

> [!Important] Tasks
> - commands given to elm runtime to deal with things like randomness, time, data acquire, interaction with the browser APIs
> - given as commands in update function

Therefore:
```
state of the app = f(current state, action)
```

- The type `Cmd` - command for Elm Runtime (like HTTP)

## Testing the HTML
- making our lives easier by using the HTML classes

## HTML 💭

```html
<elem attr1 = "..." attr2=.....>
	child1
	child2
	...
<\elem>
```

```elm
elem [attr1, ...] [child1, child2...]

```

> [!note] Tips
> -  use List.concat instead of (++) for multiple elements
> - can make attributes optional using if statements and concatenating lists
