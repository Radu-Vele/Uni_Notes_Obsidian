# Reading Material Takeaways

- make functions more ergonomic and concise
- hide some details

## Exposing modules
- can choose which function to expose
- similar to encapsulations met in OOP
- to export all type variants we need to specify `(..)`

> [!Remark] If we want to omit `exposing(..)` 
> We need to refer the wanted function/type by calling `ModuleName.functionName`

- can use qualified imports ... like in Python - Recommended 👍

>[!question] Question 4.1.1
>- prevent users to instantiate types that would not be valid
>- look at Date.elm

>[!question] Question 4.1.2
>- private constructors are used

- tip: use `Debug.todo` to test incomplete implemetations

## Higher Order Functions 👑

> Functions that manipulate/return other functions

### Curried functions
- when we don't pass enough parameters to a functions another function waiting for the rest of parameters is returned


### Point-free style
> hide the parameters the function is applied to

- if we omit a parameter we use currying to return a partial function
- don't use it a lot - Istvan confirmed ✅

> [!Question] 
> Listing 4.3.1 got me a bit confused 😵. Check the `point-free style` with @Istvan

## Lambda Expressions $\lambda$

>[!Important] Nameless, Short, Arguments to other functions

```elm
\param1 -> param2 -> param3 -> body

--Curried lambdas
(\param1 -> \param2 -> \param3 -> body) 
--the same as
(\param1 param2 param3 -> body)
```

## Closures

> Function that captures its environment when created

- it is used to set up other functions
- not sure about its use though

	When we use let in we can use parameters from outside the scope

- has something to do with the immutabilty

---

## Combinator functions
> Functions with no free variables 

### Const
- create a function that returns an argument specified when defining it

### Flip
- reverse the order of parameters

### Uncurry
- take curried function and return a function that takes a tuple as parameters

---

## Lists cont'd

### Take

```elm
take n l = ... --take first n elements from list l and return as a list
```

Extension: `takeWhile (\...) list` the lambda is a predicate whose boolean result determines if the take continues or not
 
### Drop

```elm
drop n l = ... --remove n elements from the list and return it
```

Extension: `dropWhile (\...) list`


### Zip & Unzip
- explained in lectures 🤐

### Map
- apply a function to each list element

### Filter
- remove elements that don't match a *predicate*

### Foldl
- apply an operation that "feeds" with the list elements start from last
- apply a binar operator to list
- tail recursive

### Foldr
- start from first
- not tail recursive as goes through the whole list to compute the operation

> [!Question]
> Clarify the difference between `foldl` and `foldr`:
> - we can imagine that we have the list and `fold start l` and fold replaces each cons with an op and the nil element with a start
> - the difference bettwen the l and e is the `left or right associativity`
> - foldl appends a `[ ]` at the beginning of the list

```elm
import Lists as L
> L.foldl (::) [] [1, 2, 3]
[3,2,1] : List number
> L.foldr (::) [] [1, 2, 3]
[1,2,3] : List number
> sum = L.foldl (+) 0
<function> : List number -> number
> sum [1, 2, 3]
6 : number
```


### All and Any
- check if all/any list element matches with a given predicate

## Sorting

### Quicksort
- pretty straightforward implementation
 
>ToDo: try it out

### String
- can easily be transformed in a list of chars but supports most list function defined before.

# Problems

Strategy - we should take a look for 10-15 mins
