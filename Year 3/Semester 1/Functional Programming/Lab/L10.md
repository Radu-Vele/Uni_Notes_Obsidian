# Type classes

- the interesting part of Haskell ðŸ™€
- difference from elm: we don't use type variables (type constraints) in Haskell

### Type classes by default
- constrain the parameters using type Classes
- define them and create instances

### Semigroup

> [!info] Semigroup
> Elements and operations on them 
> - need to be associative

- `<>` mappend operation

### Monoid

> [!tip] Monoid
> - semigroup with a neutral element

- mempty operation (neutral element)

### Values
- a value has a `type` and in haskell, a type has a `kind` `*`
- e.g. Maybe type is generic meaning that it receives a value and gives back another (like a function)

> [!info] Kind of a type
> - if the type has parameters then it would be `* -> *`

### Questions

Q1:

Q2: appendable is Semigroup, and monoid is not in Elm

Q3:
- and is both (n.e. is true)
- or is both (e.n is false)
- min for int 
	- maxBound::Int element is the neutral element
- min for Integer
	- no neutral element
- div for Int
	- nothing (not internal)
- div for Float
