## Functors
> [!important] What's a functor
> Like a container (context) for a value. The value can be taken and kept in its context

```haskell
fmap :: (a->b) -> f a -> f b
```

### Applicative
- specifies how we can apply a function that is in the context to a value that is in the context

```haskell
<*> :: f (a->b) -> f a -> f b
```

How to use functors for functions with more parameters?
- all functions are curried 
- we have the functions in a context
- then, the applicative works for the functions with more parameters

```haskell
import Control.Aplicative
-- liftA2 ::  a -> b -> c -> fa -> fb -> fc
liftA2 (+) (Just 1) (Just 2) -- Just 3
```

> [!info] Maybe at the test
> - other forms of writing the applicative:

```haskell
-- 1st way
(+) <$> Just 1 <*> Just 2 -- Just (1 + ) <*> Just 2

--2nd way
pure (+)  <*> Just 1 <*> Just 2 -- pure wraps the + in a Just
```

## Monads
cool video in PDF â–¶

- why? - we might have functions that return values in a context

```haskell
half :: Int -> Maybe Int
```

> [!important] The monad `>>= :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b`
> - enables us to chain functions without having to implement error handling

```haskell
return  16 >>= half >>= half >>= half

return 30 >>= half >>= half >>= half
-- here it will fail at 15 so the beauty of it is that the Nothing propagates
```

# I/O handling
Spoiler: Use Monads

## IO monad
Consider the External world as an environment

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO () -- write on screen

main :: IO ()

getLine :: IO String -- works like an effect
```

What happens after getLine - can use `>>=` to create an echo
```haskell
getLine >>= putStrLn
```

Another operator
```haskell
>> :: m a -> m b -> m b 
-- may be misleading, must remember that monads are treated like effects ish
```

### Do notation
A syntax sugaring for dealing with these moments

```haskell
main = do
	putStrLn "..."
	name <- getLine -- binding, `<-` extracts the string from IO and puts it in name
	putStrLn name
```

`<-` Can be written when the righthand side expression returns a value in Context
`let x = 2` for example, can have the same effect for a righthand side expression that just returns a value


## Interaction with the System
- files, command line args

### Working with files
- the IO is lazy (like haskell)
What happens for `readFile`: the path is given but if we don't call `readFile` the file is not accessed
`writeFile` - takes stream that may or not be available
`getContents` - opens stdin as a stream

### Example
- crypt / decrypt a stream

### Questions
1. A: `andThen` in elm is the same thing as `>>=`, similarly `liftA2` is similar to `map2`
2. A: for `toLower` thanks to laziness we only need one character in memory
	1. wordbest case a character
	2. Read an entire word (best case)
3. A: `readFiles`
```haskell
readFile :: String -> IO String 

readFiles :: [String] -> IO [String]

readFiles files = sequenceA (map readFile files)

map readFile files -- returns List (IO String) a.k.a. [IO String]
--sequenceA knows how to take a list of monads and transpose the IO with List
```


# Problems
```haskell
-- 10.8.3.
-- Write an interactive Haskell program that asks a user for their weight (in kilograms) and
-- height (in meters) and calculates their BMI using the following formula

-- done in exampleIO.hs
```
