Revisit concepts and exercises (don't spend too much time)

- Lab 1 - REPL, Function Definitions, Recursion, ifs
	- [ ] Done

	- [ ] Done
- Lab 3 - Type variables & Constraints, Error handling types, Lists
	- [ ] Done
- Lab 4 - Debug, Higher Order Functions, Lists++
	- [ ] Done

### Concepts where I answered wrong at the quiz
- Tail/Head recursive (L1)
- Records, Tuples, etc. (L2)
- List operations (L2)
	- foldl  
	- foldr

> [!important] FOLDL vs FOLDR in `ELM!`
> 
> foldL ( / ) z \[a, b, c, d\] = d /( c / (b/ (a / z)))
> 
> foldR ( / ) z \[a, b, c, d] = a / (b / (c / (d / z )))

- Inferred types
- Maybe | Nothing

### Try out examples that I did not understand.
- [ ] Done
