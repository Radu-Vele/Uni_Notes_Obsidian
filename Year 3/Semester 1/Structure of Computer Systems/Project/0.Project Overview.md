# ðŸŒ‹ Hazard Detection and Avoidance Unit

# Pipeline Recap:
---

> Based on the CA book

## Stages:

```mermaid
graph TD
IF[Instruction Fetch]
--> ID[Instruction Decode]
--> EX[Execution Stage - usually ALU]
--> MEM[Memory Stage - access memory]
--> WB[Write Back Stage - write to register file]

```

## Possible hazard issues ðŸŒ :

### 1. Structural (already solved)

 > [!INFO] Because of resource dependency

>Solution:
>- independent Instruction and Data memory
>- Asynchronous reads
>- RF write in the $1^{st}$ half and reads in the $2^{nd}$ half of the clock cycle

### 2. Data

>[!Info] Use data before it's ready
>RAW hazards
>The currently executing instruction is dependent on an earlier one still in the pipeline

> Solution: Add extra hardware
> - Hazard detection
> - **Forwarding Unit** (additional control signals and data is forwarded through the unit that looks pretty much combinational)
> - Special case for **Load Data Hazards** (need stalls): **Hazard detection unit**
	- instruction reorder (can I do this, not sure tho)

More Details About Solving Data Hazards are Described in 4.7

### More details
- detecting dependencies
- how a Forwarding unit is implemented
- how the Hazard Detection Unit is implemented (to detect hazards and insert stalls)


### 3. Control

>[!info] Related to flow control
>A.k.a. branch hazard

**Solutions**:
-  flushing
- Branch prediction
	- can predict - always not taken (stall if the branch is taken)
	- predictors based on previous behavior
- Delay branch slot (used in MIPS architecture)

> [!Question] Can I use the prediction algorithms

More is described in dection 4.8

### More Details:
- Assume branch not taken - vague
- Reduce Delay of Branches - add IF flush (linked to assume not taken)
- Dynamic branch prediction - use a Branch Prediction Buffer to check whether the previous branch has been taken - implementation not provided

## Takeaways:
- in the book there are implementations for the following solutions:
	- hazard detection unit (insert stalls)
	- forwarding unit (resolve data dependencies)
	- assume branch not taken and flush :
