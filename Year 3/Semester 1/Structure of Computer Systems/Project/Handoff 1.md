# Research and Introduction

### Introduction
- describe what I'm gonna do

### Bibliographic research
- information about the subject
- formal stuff, not my thoughts (the meaning of terms), algorithms
- all standards we find
- include references (citation style of my choice)

## Sources ideas
- Patterson & Hennesy, Computer Organization and Design, 2014, Chapter 4.5 Pipeline Hazards, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8

## TODO
- [ ] **RESEARCH**: Pana data viitoare: **Ce** hazarduri rezolv si **cum** le rezolv?
	- use a MIPS multi-cycle pipeline 🐿 implementation
	- Find alternative info (Computer Organization and Design - Patterson & Hennesy Chapter 4.5) 
		- *Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris* - **not additional info on hazards**
	- Check SCS Course on Hazards
	
	 - [x] Partly Done
	 - [x] ToDo: Research if I can implement the Branch Prediction


- [ ] Begin with the introductory documentation (1. and 2.) - until next project
	- [x] Done


> [!Question] Questions?
> Did anyone ever implement dynamic branch prediction? 
> 
> 	- yes I should implement it, maybe behavioral 
> 	- pick an algorithm (anything table-based)
> 
> Any recommended bibliographic source?	
> 
> 	- search for dynamic branch prediction algorithms
> 
> Include graphics from book or build them myself?
> 
> 	- the figure need a number and caption and reference (if not ours)
