First, put thoughts in order and in **project proposal** write a list of features that we will meet.
- project proposal (all promised features)
	- [ ] Done 
- project plan (divide our work)

- analysis
	- [ ] Done

Test the existing pipeline:
- testbench
	- [ ] Done
- Vivado simulation
	- [ ] Done

## Analysis section
- elaborate the bibliographic research by discussing the implementation, include pipeline diagrams
- maybe flowcharts and **algorithms** (in my case the logic behind the Dynamic Branch Prediction)
- pipeline diagrams
- describe state machines (control states)
