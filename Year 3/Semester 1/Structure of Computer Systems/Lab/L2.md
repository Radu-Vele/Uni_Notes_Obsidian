# Laboratory 2

## Reading Material Takeaways

### Main theme
- TSC (Time-Stamp Counter) accessible through `RDTSC` instruction - counts the number of clock cycles
$$ Time_{seconds} = \frac{cycles_{nr}}{CPU_{\nu}}$$
- My frequency: base 3 GHz but in practice floating around 2GHz
- There are a series of issues to take into consideration

### out-of-order exec $\to$ use CPUID
- method top solve out-of-order execution:
```
rdtsc
mov time_high, edx
mov time_low, eax
add var, ecx
rdtsc
sub eax, time_low
sbb edx, time_high
mov time_high, edx
mov time_low, eax
```

- method in C
```c
unsigned cycles_high1=0, cycles_low1=0, cupid_time=0;
unsigned cycles_high2=0, cycles_low2=0;
unsigned __int64 temp_cycles1=0, temp_cycles2=0;

__int64 total_cycles=0;
//compute the CPUID overhead
__asm {
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	mov cycles_high1, edx; High bits
	mov cycles_low1, eax; Low bits
	popad
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	popad
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	mov cycles_high1, edx
	mov cycles_low1, eax
	popad
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	popad

	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	mov cycles_high1, edx
	mov cycles_low1, eax
	popad
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	sub eax, cycles_low1
	mov cupid_time, eax
	popad
}

cycles_high1=0;
cycles_low1=0;
//Measure the code sequence

__asm {
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	mov cycles_high1, edx
	mov cycles_low1, eax
	popad
}
//Section of code to be measured
__asm {
	pushad
	CPUID
	RDTSC
	mov cycles_high2, edx
	mov cycles_low2, eax
	popad
}

temp_cycles1 = ((unsigned __int64)cycles_high1 << 32) | cycles_low1;

temp_cycles2 = ((unsigned __int64)cycles_high2 << 32) | cycles_low2;

total_cycles = temp_cycles2 - temp_cycles1 - cpuid_time;
```

### Data cache
- we want everything to be in L1 cache
- **solution**: call the function the second time and measure it then + redundant calls to be sure

### Context Switch
- set process priority to highest - won't do it now

### Multi-core
- process needs to be set to one core - won't do it now

### Frequency changes
- OS settings can be changes (or just count clk_cycles instead of frequency)

## Tasks
### 1. Measuring instructions

|Instruction|Measure clock cycles 5 times|Result (most often result)|
|-|-|-|
|ADD-r||
| ADD-v||
|MUL|- FPU works with stack|
|FDIV||
|FSUB||


### 2. Array sort 
- static vs dynamic array
- review sorting


- Questions need to be answered as well
	1. The difference between differen kinds of ADD
	2. The rest are on the group
