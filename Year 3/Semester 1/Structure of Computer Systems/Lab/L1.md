# Benchmarks & Latency

## Tasks:
1. Install software and test our laptops (won't really do it rn)
2. Prime.cpp measurements

- measure time
```cpp
clock_t start = clock();

/*...*/

clock_t end = clock();

value = end - start;

//interval = 10 000

```

- how we take notes of the measures: 

|nr of threads| R1| R2 | R3| R4 |R5|Avg|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0 (sequential program in which we can modify the code to exclude the threading or write our own code)||
|1||
|2||
|...||
|8||


## **TODO** until next Friday:
- load a PDF lab1_vele_radu-augustin.pdf on moodle in which we mention
- The interval for the measurements: 2 - 10.000
- Tabel
- Answers to the questions (Andreea noted):
	1.  How does the avg exec time of the sequential compares with 1 thread and why 
	2. What happens as we increase the nr of threads (lowers)
