# Cache Implementation 💰

### Task: Implement a Cache Memory in VHDL 
- Direct-associative

# About the cache (in general)
- contains some blocks copied from main memory
- each block has a corresponding **tag**

Example of operation mode:
- Read
	- search data within cache
	- if not found, search main memory
- Write
	- if word (address) is found in cache, the write is performed and the main memory is updated
	- otherwise, the block containing the word is loaded into the cache and the write happens.

# Our Implementation

> [!important] Custom-ish Nomenclature
> - `word` = 64bit entry data that "lives" on the data bus
> - `block/set` = 32Byte entry data that "lives" on a line in the cache and contains `4 words`

> We consider we are found during the program execution when the cache has already been updated a few times and we want to monitor its behavior. There is no need to update the cache/main memory when cache misses are met. 🎯

### CPU issues a READ
- check if the tag matches the `TAG_RAM_CONTENT[set_address]`
	- if match => ENABLE the DATA_RAM (`CS = 1`) for reading (`Cache_write = 0`)
		- extract the proper word from the 
	- else => `CS = 0` (main memory is accessed)

---

### CPU issues a WRITE
- check if the tag matches the `TAG_RAM_CONTENT[set_address]`
	- if match => ENABLE the DATA_RAM (`CS = 1`) for writing (`Cache_write = 1`)
	- else => `CS = 0` 

## Testing:

### 1. Successful read ✅ 

#### Timing: 
- init at `20 ns`
- tag read (rising edge 🕐) `25 ns`
- data cache access (falling edge 🕐) `30 ns`

#### Address wanted: 
`x"A2C4_0048"`	

|tag (14)|set-addr (13)|displacement(5)|
|-|-|-|
|1010_0010_1100_01 | 00_0000_0000_010| 0_1000 |

#### Data memory content at address (0x2) (a block)

|data 3 (64)|data 2 (64)|
|-|-|
|`x"0000_0000_0000_000A"`|`x"0000_0000_0000_000B"`|

|data 1 (64)| data 0 (64)|
|-|-|
|`x"0000_0000_0000_000C"`|`x"0000_0000_0000_000D"`|

#### Tag memory content at address (0x2): 
`1010_0010_1100_01`

---

### 2. Unsuccessful read ❌

#### Timing: 
- init at `40 ns`

#### Address wanted: `x"A2C3_0046"`	
Tags won't match

The same values to the other signals

---

### 3. Successful write ✅

#### Timing:
- init at `60 ns`

#### Address wanted: 
`x"A2C4_0048"`	

#### CPU Data bus out 
`x"AAAA_BBBB_BBBB_AAAA"`

Content at data memory (0x4) after the write
|data(1)|...|
|-|-|
|`x"AAAA_BBBB_BBBB_AAAA"`||

---

### 4. Unsuccessful write ❌

#### Timing:
- init at `80 ns`
 
#### Address wanted 
`x"A2C4_0084"`
