# VHDL Lab

## Basic VHDL Recap

- Next lab will present assignment with one-week deadline

>[!Important] This Lab Purpose: Recap VHDL

### Key concepts:
- Entity - blackbox
- Architecture - wired logic
	- Behavioral
	- Structural
	- Data Flow
- Signal - undefined values occur when multiple processes try to write on the same signal.

## TODO:
- a MUX (in-class)
	- [x] Done
- testbenches
	- empty entity and the component to be tested is defined in the architecture (Structural)
	- useful for debug (write a testbench for a new component) - we will upload simulation
