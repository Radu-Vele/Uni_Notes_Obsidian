# FPGA Synthesis

## Real-time clock

## Simple memory
- Read first vs Write first memory
	- makes sense when both Read and Write control signals are HIGH
- sync read/write or async

## FIFO Memory
- Queue-like

What do we want to set as convention?
	- remove from 0 index
	- how to know where to insert data (keep a counter that tells where to insert)
	- what happens when memory is full? $\to$ add `full` flag
	- option: circular memory
	- what happens when we remove something?
		- can shift all
		- can have a "pointer"
	- enable signal? not the case only when we have multiple on-chip fifos
	- size: 8 x 8 (8 addresses that store 8 bits each)

# ToDo
- implement the FIFO
- Send until Sunday
	- Or present on the board if Synthesizing / testbench (not in my case ðŸ˜Ž)
