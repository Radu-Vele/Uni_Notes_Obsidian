# Case study CTP 🚌

## Automat Components:
- Screen 
	- use a microcontroller (MCU) to read it or a CPU
- NFC Interface
	- reader
- POS (point of sale)
	- connection is done using software programs so it s hard to implement in VHDL
- Printer for tickets
- Cash bank (with counters for each banknote)
- Cash_In
- Cash_Out (rest)

- Database (Remote)

### Use case 🕺: New Subscription
1. Push (Create Subscription)
2. Scan Card (CTP)
	`MCU initiates the read card to the NFC reader`
	`NFC sends back the read ID`
3. Input PIN
4. Scan Again 🦆
	Create memory to avoid re-scan 
	`*`
	Choose subscription type
	Scan again
	`*`
5. Choose interval
6. Scan Card 🦆 🦆
7. Pay
	1. Cash (MCU sends a signal to receive money and the amount, get back the inserted cash)
