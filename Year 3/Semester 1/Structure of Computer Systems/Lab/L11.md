# DRAM & Cache Memory Design

# DRAM
- difference static vs dynamic memory

# Cache Design
- choose between direct mapping or two set associative mapping
- brings info closest to CPU
- fastest access memory
- cache hit
- cache miss

> [!info] Todo
> study RAM vs Cache differences in usability

CPU-->Cache-->MainMemory
```

- use least significant 6 bits in to address the cache
- next 2 ones are used as a tag

Components:
- cache memory
- tag memory 

### Computations for Direct Mapping - Caches:

> [!info] Todo
> - understand the caches

Info:
- address
- data width
- cache capacity
- set size (blocks from cache memory)

Wanted:
- tag length
- nr of blocks
$$nr_{sets}= \frac{cache_{capacity}}{set_{size}}=2^s$$
$$tag_{bits} = address_{size} - (s + d)$$
$$2^d=set_{size}$$
