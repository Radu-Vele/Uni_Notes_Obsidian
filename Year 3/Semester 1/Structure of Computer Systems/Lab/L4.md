# ALU

## Reading Material Takeaways

> [!note] Missing info in the lab
>  The lab info for CSaveA and WTM is incomplete

- tradeoff: area (power consumption) vs computational power

### ALU
- input = registers
- output = registers
- selection = control signals
- status = status register

### Operations:
- adder
- multiplier
- divisor

## Addition
Half adder - no CIN no COUT

### **Full adders**: add corresponding I/O

$$x+y=x \text{ xor } y$$
$$cout = x \cdot cin + y \cdot cin + x \cdot y$$
 
### **Ripple carry adder**:
 - can use for-generate instruction to generate all adders
	use multiple full adders 

### **Carry Lookahead adder**:
- the carry is computed in a separate block to save waiting time for producing the carry signal
- two functions are used: propagate and generate
- the only carry to be known is the cin

- can generalize the recurence formula to have identical blocks
or
- can use different carry blocks

### Carry Select Adder
- split numbers in halves $\Rightarrow$ 2 full adders each adding half of the number
- use 2 options for the high order adder (in the second option add a 1 as well) the proper option is chosen using the carry out of the lower order adder as selection of a MUX

### Carry Save Adder
- useful when more numbers are about to be added
- makes sense only for $\ge$ numbers to be added

### Serial Adder
- skip ‚õ∑

## Multiplication
Methods:

## Shift and Add multiplications: 
like the way we are used to with multiplying numbers

- can avoid shifting the Q register and just
- btw: the adder can be implemented with the '+' in VHDL
- spend a minute on it üôÇ

## Wallace tree: 
reduce the complexity of the first method
- 2 carry save adders and a carry propagate adder at the end

# Assesment and todo
## ToDo:
- 4-bit counter
- Implement carry lookahead adder for 4-bit numbers
- Design a Carry Save Adder
- Implement  Wallace tree for 4-bit numbers

**Rules**:
- Top level module is structural, the rest is our choice
