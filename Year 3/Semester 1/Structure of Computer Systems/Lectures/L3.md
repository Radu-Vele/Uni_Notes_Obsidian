## Arithmetical operation using Floating Point

> Floating point $\ne$ real

Many issues related to them:
- can't represent 0.3

### FP Adder/subtracter
- approach: increment (align to the greatest power of 10) exponent, shift mantissa to right, add mantissas with a regular adder

```
Check slides for the accurate algorithm

Load operands
Compare exponents:
	- maybe the difference between them is so big (bigger than nr of bits allocated for mantissa) => don' t shift the mantissa to the right (result is the bigger number - round the small boi-)
	- if equal just add / subtract mantissas
	- if first exp > second exp => shift to the right the greater nr and increment exponent till they are equal
	- [...]
```

### Multiply and divide

### Add with saturation
