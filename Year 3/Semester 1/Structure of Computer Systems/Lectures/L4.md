# CPU

## Idyllic view

## Modern processors
- on-chip memory / ports
- parallelization (SIMD, threads, tasks, ...)

### Simple computer
- very simple
- von Neumann architecture
- multi-cycle (4 steps/instruction - fixed)

Ex: additional instruction to implement on the simple architecture

Interesting concepts: phase counter

## MIPS
### Recap stuff

### Pipeline
- assembly line style
- pipeline registers

### Superscalar 
- 2 instructions fetched at a time
$$CPI=\frac{1}{2}$$
- build a computer with 2 pipelines

### Superpipeline
- half a clock for each instruction
- same effect as doubling the clock frequency `ish`, e.g. consider rising and falling edge as synchronizers

### Hazards
**Data**
	RAW
		- typical
	WAR
		- doesn't happen in our case as write is the final step and the read was done already. only in superscalar
	WAW
		- only in superscalar (speculative order execution of instructions)
	RAR
		- not hazardous

Solve data hazards: 
	Detect it and wait until data dependency is solved
	Instructions reordering:
		Who? Programmer / Compiler / Processor should do it ðŸ˜² - nowadays
