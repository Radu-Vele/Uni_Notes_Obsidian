How to improve performance with multiple CPUs?

> [!info] When technlogy limitations occur
> - get parallelism involved

## Parallelism
- DLP - SIMD architecture 
- ILP - use pipelining
- TLP - taks level parallelism
	- have multiple CPUs to improve performance and execute more tasks

## Thread-level Parallelism

The OS decides what tasks to allocate where.

### Issues to be discussed:
Unlike single-processor systems there are more problems like:
- synchronization
- data consistency issues - more threads want to access/change the same resource 
- concurrent access
- communication between threads

### Amhahl's law - presented in slide
$$S= \frac{1}{1-q+\frac{q}{n}}$$
where S is the speedup, q is the fraction of program to be parallelized, n = number of threads

> [!warning] The speedup is limited
> By the fraction of the application that can be executed in parallel, not by number of CPUs

The speedup in this formula is calculated for **one** application
