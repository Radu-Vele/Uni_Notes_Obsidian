# Hazard Resolution

## Scoreboard üéº
- data hazards
- structural hazards

### Where does it fit?
- have a mechanism for detecting data dependency between instruction (dependency-tree)
- pipeline implementation
- variable number of cycles
- limited number of resources
- we have enough hardware to implement (hardware equivalent to implementing FP operations)

### Method
- use a record about the state of different instructions and functional units to avoid hazard cases
- **out of order** instruction execution $\to$ **in order** completion
- **dynamic scheduling**  - consider whether data is available + units are available

Scoreboard = keep track in what is happening in the computer
	like an accounting ethod

### Implementation:
- 4 stages: 
	- **ID1**: decode
		- WAW check
	- **ID2**: read operands
		- RAW check
	- **EX**: perform operations
		- may take multiple clk cycles (send a signal when `done`)
	- **WB**: finish it up 
		- WAR check (wait for other instructions to finish their read operations from the reosurce you are about to overwrite)

- Notations and variables:
	1. Instruction status (stages from above)
	2. FU status (`Busy`, `Op` - what operation the unit performs, `Fi, Fj, Fk` - keep track of registers, `Qj, Qk` - origin of the different operands used, `Rj, Rk` - state if our registers are ready to be used)
	3. Register result status

## Tomasulo üö¢

### Why?
- scoreboard doesn't solve structural hazards
- there is no forwading in scoreboard
- other reasons described in slides

### Method
- solve WAR, WAW + structural hazards avoidance
- **register renaming** = if more instructions are using the same register, the hardware can allocate different copies of the same named refister. Data dependency is not inferred in this case (no logical dependency).
- **CDB** = allow hardware to get result directly from FU output (no waiting until WB stage) $\Rightarrow$ Forwarding üëº

### Implementation
- stages: 3 Stages (theory) 4 In reality (add commit stage)
	- Issue: - if FU available
		- Register renaming happens here
		- The programs deal with less registers than there are in reality as searching would become tidious
	- Execute: 
	- Write result
	- Commit stage: write back results to GPR
- Reservation station = buffer data 
	Designed to avoid data dependencies, WAR, RAW
- Redundant FUs - More ALUs
- Commit stage - write result to **Reorder Buffer** (hardware to copy results from the registers into their final destination) `in-order` commit

### Example: 
- slides
- faster than scoreboarding

## Branch prediction üåø
Control Hazards - my interests for the `project`

Brunch prediction üç≥üçû

> [!info] Idea: 
> find methods to avoid executing instructions that are not supposed to. Predict them somehow

### Static prediction
- predict based on the type of branch instruction

### Examples:
1. procedure call - take it
2. unconitional - take it
3. loop - take it
4. forward branches (exceptions in the program) - dont't take it

### When to use?
- many loops, few conditional jumps

### Dynamic prediction
- solve more smart

> [!info] Idea
> Take history into consideration. Like caching previous decisions (analogy with following the same route to work everyday) üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Methods:

### Next Line Predictor
- suppose all addresses taken + decisions after jumps are memorized in a history, that history is used for predicting next execution
- requirements:
	- Memory to store all jumps (last made ones at least)
- doesn't work properly for loops

### Saturating counters
- allocate a counter on n bits for each of the types of the jumps
- you need to have at least `2 identical decisions` to change a decision
- works nice for loops

- use BTB and BHT for storing these counters

### 2 Level adaptive predictor

Sometimes you need context for which the decision was taken.

Use the context (number formed using the last n decisions) that will index a table of saturating counters

---

Further on, we need some hashing methods to reduce the n previously mentioned

### Local branch prediction
- works better
- each memory zone requires its branch table

### Global branch prediction
- less efficient but better memory usage

This allocation can be allocatted according to the techniques:
1. Gshare
2. Gselect

---

Combinations of local and global prediction:

### Correlated prediction
- detect the context globally and find a local predictor
- best option is to combine them

### Tournament prediction 
- find

---

Neither of the methods is the best
