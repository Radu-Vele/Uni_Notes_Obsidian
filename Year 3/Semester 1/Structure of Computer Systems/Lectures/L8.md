# Microprocessors

to recover

### Nehalem architecture
- direct communication between CPUs (QPI)
- more prepared for parallel computation

### Sandy bridge architecture

Innovations:
- AVX = MMX (SSE2) unit successor 

Architecture:
- cores connected through network

## Next Intel trends
- Tic - new architecture
- Tac - use the new architector on a new integration ratio (smaller size)
