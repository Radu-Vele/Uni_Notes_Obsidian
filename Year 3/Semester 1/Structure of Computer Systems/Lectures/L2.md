## Computer performance & Optimality
- Requirements discussed in [L1](obsidian://open?vault=University%20Notes&file=Year%203%2FSemester%201%2FStructure%20of%20Computer%20Systems%2FLectures%2FL1) 

### Choosing the architecture

Computer types:
	- General purpose
	- Dedicated (military, scientific, ...)
		- e.g. GRID computer (nuclear physics), javelin rockets
		- drones, industrial devices + IoT, measurements + analysis

Based on processor:
	- Single processor
	- Multi processor (cores + GPU + HDD processor)
		- Distributed systems
		- GRIDs - predicted to have more success
		- Cloud (CaaS, StorageAaS, Paas, SaaS - pay per use)

> [!important] Optimal computer architecture

**HPC** = high performance computer
	- parallel, 10.000...+ processors inside, 
	- communication is not TCP/IP (slow), but fast ones (Cray's Gemini, InfiniBand) #escrocuJaponez (big Bottleneck üçæ)

**PC**  
	- what we can fit in a case for 1000$ ish
