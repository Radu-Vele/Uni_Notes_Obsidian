# Lecture 2 Performance

## Transistors evolution
- current: 5nm technology ($\approx$ 50 atoms of Silicon)
	- Therefore, physics laws are a bit different therefore Moore's law decrease will get to a stop
	- analogy: number of pixels, SSD capacity

### Amdahl's law
- measure the **speedup** of a new component (in comparison with an old one)

e.g.  improve the architecture of a FPU (2x faster) therefore the overall improvement is computed according to the formula

	$$\eta = \frac{t_{old\_exec}}{t_{new\_exec}}$$
	compute: 1% of app uses FP instruction $\Rightarrow$ $\eta=5\%$  

- improval is quite small even with great component improvements (Even $\infty$)
