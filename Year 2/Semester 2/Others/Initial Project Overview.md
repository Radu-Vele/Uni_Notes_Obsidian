# Initial Project Overview

## Ideas
- Audio-Books platform with log-in :sound: :closed_book: 

- Gamificated environmental monitoring system (users) :recycle:
  - air quality & pollution (used with wearables)
    - gather data and generate reports
    - civil impact

- Soil management app :seedling:
  - users bring in information (colorize a map area ?)
  - have farmers as users (determine the needs of the soil + see the irrigation area)
  - map the farmed land + irrigation system + crops situation
  - map forest areas
  - more actors + interaction between them
  - available land patches
  - add devices that monitor the quality in certain areas
  - incorporate weather

## Tech stack proposal

|Part|Technology|
