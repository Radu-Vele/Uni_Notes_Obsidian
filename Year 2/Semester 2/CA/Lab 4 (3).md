# Lab 4

Next labs -> MIPS Single cycle on 16 bits (attention to that)

## Instruction Set Architecture

Types
|Register|Immediate| Jump|
|-|-|-|

### ToDo:
---
1. 
- select 2 additional R type
- select 2 additional I type
- from the lecture documentation/appendix no.6
- *not* division, multiplication only if try-hard
- write encoding and how they work (L3/slide. 15)

2.
- test program in assembly and then in machine code

** if wanted we can write a more complex program for demonstrating different instructions (Fibonnaci series of a certain number)

3.
- Data path for the MIPS 16 (Lab 5 but changed a bit)
- same components

--> Next 5 labs PC, Instr Mem, Ctrl Unit, Reg File, Execution Unit (Alu, Mux), Memory unit.

 *! Understand instructions*

### ***Upload - by Sunday 23:59***
- picture of the paper / notepad
- all of the 3 assignments
