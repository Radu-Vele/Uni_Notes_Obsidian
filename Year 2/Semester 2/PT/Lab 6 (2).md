# Lab 6

## Ideas
### Peak hour :white_check_mark:
- the time when the sum of the size of the queues is maximum
### Average Service Time 
- the average of the service time of all clients

## Average Waiting Time
- for each client that exits the queue:

$(\sum_{i = 0}^{nr_{clients}} t_{exit_{i}} - t_{arrival_{i}})/{nr_{clients}}$
